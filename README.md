DietNerd (https://dietnerd.org/) is a web-based LLM-powered tool that answers diet and nutrition-related questions by extracting and summarizing information from academic papers sourced from PubMed. Users can ask questions on various topics, including dietary strategies, nutrition science, and health outcomes, and receive detailed, evidence-based responses based on the latest research. It utilizes a unique article search strategy and is built with multiple safety-motivated touchpoints, including a safety analysis that evaluates the pros, cons, and risks of the topics in question.

The tool is designed to provide reliable and up-to-date information for individuals, health professionals, and researchers alike. Our mission is to enrich conversations between patients and their medical providers and equip users with knowledge.

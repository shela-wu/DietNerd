https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36518821/,Does folic acid supplementation have a positive effect on improving memory? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials YES,36518821,2022-11-28,"INTRODUCTION:
The results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of folic acid supplementation on memory status due to various heterogeneity, dosage, duration, and cognitive function assessments were inconclusive. Therefore, we have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of folic acid supplementation on memory in RCTs.

METHOD:
Comprehensive computerized systematic searches were conducted throughout Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from inception until February 2022 to investigate the effect of folic acid supplementation memory levels in RCTs. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were used to estimate the overall effect size using random-effects meta-analyses.

RESULTS:
The overall results of nine trials with 641 participants, revealed that folic acid supplementation did not significantly change memory score compared to placebo (SMD: 0.12; 95% CI: -0.17, 0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.418; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 62.6%). However, subgroup analyses showed that supplementation with folic acid had favorable effects on memory levels considering the following conditions: (1) doses lower than 1 mg/day, (2) treatment lasting more than 6 months, (3) conducted in eastern countries, and (4) in participants equal to or older than 70 years old. The dose-response analysis suggested a significant favorable effect on memory status at doses of 6-11 mg/d and a significant decline at doses of 17-20 mg/d.

DISCUSSION:
Although we did not find a significant effect of folic acid supplementation on memory, there were some suggestions of beneficial effects in the subgroup analyses.",Does folic acid supplementation have a positive effect on improving memory?,"Although we did not find a significant effect of folic acid supplementation on memory, there were some suggestions of beneficial effects in the subgroup analyses.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34498070/,Plant-predominant eating patterns - how effective are they for treating obesity and related cardiometabolic health outcomes? - a systematic review YES,34498070,2022-04-08,"CONTEXT:
The obesity epidemic is a main driver of the chronic disease epidemic; however, present treatment approaches have suboptimal efficacy.

OBJECTIVES:
To assess the efficacy of plant-predominant (vegan, vegetarian, plant-based whole foods [PBWFs]) diets in treating obesity and its main cardiometabolic sequelae: hyperlipidemia (HLD); indices of insulin resistance, glycemic control, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2); and cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertension (HTN).

DATA SOURCES:
A systematic search of multiple databases was conducted for articles published between November 2019 and February 2020; databases searched included: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Cochrane, CENTRAL, and CINAHL.

DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS:
All interventional trials (randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and trials of non-randomized experimental design) that met the inclusion criteria (English language, duration of at least 4 weeks, primary end point congruent with above objectives, no major flaws in research design that would prevent interpretation) were included in the review. A total of 3135 articles were scanned and 84 were selected. The articles were collated and summarized in 2 evidence tables. Risk of bias for RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool 2 as a guide. For non-randomized trials, higher risk of bias was assumed, and the JBI Critical Appraisal tool was used as a guide to determine inclusion.

RESULTS:
Plant-based diets, in general, demonstrated improved weight control and cardiometabolic outcomes related to lipids, cardiovascular end points, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, A1C, and fasting glucose, and a lower risk of diabetes compared with usual diets and in some cases standard health-oriented diets such as the American Heart Association (AHA), American Diabetic Association (ADA), and Mediterranean diets. Preliminary studies suggest plant-predominant diets practiced as part of healthy lifestyle interventions may stabilize or even reverse DM 2 and CVD. The acceptability and sustainability of plant-predominant diets where measured were generally similar to other health-oriented diets.

CONCLUSION:
Plant-predominant diets can play a major role in reversing the obesity and chronic disease epidemics. In the setting of sustained lifestyle intervention programs, they may arrest or even reverse DM2 and CVD. Further higher-level RCTs are needed to confirm and expand on these findings.",How effective are plant-predominant eating patterns for treating obesity and related cardiometabolic health outcomes?,"Plant-predominant diets can play a major role in reversing the obesity and chronic disease epidemics.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24815945/,Is there a relationship between red or processed meat intake and obesity? A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies YES,24815945,2014-09-01,"A body of literature exists regarding the association of red and processed meats with obesity; however, the nature and extent of this relation has not been clearly established. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between red and processed meat intake and obesity. We searched multiple electronic databases for observational studies on the relationship between red and processed meat intake and obesity published until July 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) and means for obesity-related indices and for variables that may contribute to heterogeneity were calculated. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted with 21 and 18 studies, respectively (n = 1,135,661). The meta-analysis (n = 113,477) showed that consumption of higher quantities of red and processed meats was a risk factor for obesity (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.14-1.64). Pooled mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) trends showed that in comparison to those in the lowest ntile, subjects in the highest ntile of red and processed meat consumption had higher BMI (mean difference: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.90-1.84 for red meat; mean difference: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.64-2.00 for processed meat) and WC (mean difference: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.86-3.70 for red meat; mean difference: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.87-2.66 for processed meat).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37981693/,Does the ketogenic diet improve neurological disorders by influencing gut microbiota? A systematic review YES,37981693,2023-11-20,"BACKGROUND:
The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the changes in gut microbiota (GM) induced by the Ketogenic Diets (KD) as a potential underlying mechanism in the improvement of neurological diseases.

METHODS:
A comprehensive search was conducted on three electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus until December 2022. The inclusion criteria were studies that described any changes in GM after consuming KD in neurological patients. Full text of studies such as clinical trials and cohorts were added. The quality assessment of cohort studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and for the clinical trials using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. The search, screening, and data extraction were performed by two researchers independently.

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies examining the effects of the KD on the GM in neurological patients were included. Studies have shown that KD improves clinical outcomes by reducing disease severity and recurrence rates. An increase in Proteobacteria phylum, Escherichia, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Agaricus, and Mrakia genera and a reduction in Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria phyla, Eubacterium, Cronobacter, Saccharomyces, Claviceps, Akkermansia and Dialister genera were reported after KD. Studies showed a reduction in concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty acids and an increase in beta Hydroxybutyrate, trimethylamine N-oxide, and N-acetylserotonin levels after KD.

CONCLUSION:
The KD prescribed in neurological patients has effectively altered the GM composition and GM-derived metabolites.",Does the ketogenic diet improve neurological disorders by influencing gut microbiota?,The KD prescribed in neurological patients has effectively altered the GM composition and GM-derived metabolites.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12760443/,Should we recommend low-fat diets for obesity? YES,12760443,2003-05-01,"Dietary fat intake has been blamed for the increase in adiposity and has led to a worldwide effort to decrease the amount of fat in the diet. However, the comparative efficacy of this approach is debatable. Whilst short-term dietary intervention studies show that low-fat diets lead to weight loss in both healthy and overweight individuals, it is less clear if a reduction in fat intake is more efficacious than other dietary restrictions in the long term. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of low-fat diets in achieving sustained weight loss when used for the express purpose of weight loss in obese or overweight people. A comprehensive search identified six studies that fulfilled our criteria for inclusion (randomized controlled trial, participants either overweight or obese, comparison of a low-fat diet with another type of weight-reducing diet, follow-up period that was at least 6 months in duration and inclusion of participants 18 years or older without serious disease). There were a total of 594 participants in the six trials. The duration of the intervention varied from 3 to 18 months with follow-up from 6 to 18 months. There were no significant differences between low-fat diets and other weight-reducing diets in terms of sustained weight loss. Furthermore, the overall weight loss at the 12-18-month follow-up in all studies was very small (2-4 kg). In overweight or obese individuals who are dieting for the purpose of weight reduction, low-fat diets are as efficacious as other weight-reducing diets for achieving sustained weight loss, but not more so.",Should we recommend low-fat diets for obesity?,"There were no significant differences between low-fat diets and other weight-reducing diets in terms of sustained weight loss.

To assess the current evidence regarding the benefit of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyol (FODMAP) diet in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

METHODS:
Databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Medline were comprehensively searched for relevant studies through January 2017. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze the dichotomous variables (diarrhea response, abdominal pain and bloating, etc.) and the continuous variables. Random- and fixed-effects models were chosen according to heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
Two RCTs and four before-after studies with a total of 319 patients (96% in remission) were identified. Except for the constipation response, there was a significant improvement in other symptoms: diarrhea response (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11-0.52, p = 0.0003), satisfaction with gut symptoms (OR: 26.84, 95% CI: 4.6-156.54, p < 0.00001), abdominal bloating (OR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.06-0.16, p < 0.00001), abdominal pain (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.16-0.35, p < 0.00001), fatigue (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24-0.66, p = 0.0003) and nausea (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31-0.85, p = 0.009).

CONCLUSIONS:
The present meta-analysis offers proof to support that a low FODMAP diet is beneficial for reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. With the inherent limitations, the findings of this analysis remain to be confirmed and updated by further high-volume, well-designed and long-term follow-up studies.",Is a low FODMAP diet beneficial for patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,"The present analysis offers proof to support that a low FODMAP diet is beneficial for reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34251517/,Can resveratrol modulate sirtuins in obesity and related diseases? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials YES,34251517,2021-09-01,"PURPOSE:
Human sirtuins can be a powerful therapeutic target in preventing and treating obesity and age-related diseases. Some dietary components can modulate sirtuins' activity, such as resveratrol. This systematic review aimed to assess whether resveratrol (RSV), without other interventions, can stimulate sirtuins in the treatment of excess weight and its comorbidities.

METHODS:
MEDLINE/Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were used for search eligible articles. Randomized clinical trials assessing RSV supplementation on changes in the sirtuins' gene expression/protein levels was the primary outcome. Other possible changes in cardiometabolic markers were considered the second outcome. Following PRISMA guidelines and using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers independently and in parallel screened, assessed the studies' quality, and compiled data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or consulting a third author.

RESULTS:
This review included seven randomized control trials. Four articles demonstrated a significant increase in SIRT-1 with different RSV dosages and interventions time. The secondary outcomes showed improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, metabolic flexibility, total antioxidant capacity, energy expenditure changes, and reduction of ectopic accumulation of fat.

CONCLUSION:
Data from RCTs studies showed that RSV supplementation could stimulate SIRT-1 in humans, and therefore contribute to the treatment of excess weight and its comorbidities. However, more research is needed because it was not possible to confirm this effect truly.

Results of a new cross-sectional study and systematic review YES,31631671,2019-10-21,"It is assumed that diet influences the composition of gut microbiota, which in turn may affect human health status. This systematic review aimed to summarize associations of a vegan or vegetarian diet with the composition of microbiota. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase for eligible human studies with vegan or vegetarian diets as an exposure and microbiota composition as an outcome in healthy adults. Furthermore, data from our cross-sectional study with vegan participants were included.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422943/,Is There an Association Between Vitamin D Deficiency and Erectile Dysfunction? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis YES,32422943,2020-05-14,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is found very frequently in the male population, in particular in its arteriogenic form, which also represents an important predictor of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Some evidence suggests that vitamin D could play a role in cardiovascular risk prevention thanks to its ability to reduce endothelial damage, oxidative stress, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and dyslipidemia. Since ED and CVDs have pathogenic mechanisms in common, numerous studies have evaluated a possible association between vitamin D deficiency (blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml) and ED, but with conflicting results. This meta-analysis was therefore performed to clarify the discrepancy of the data so far published. To achieve this, articles have been searched extensively in the Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Academic One Files, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases from the first day they were created until January 2020. The search strategy included pertinent Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms. Of the 431 items retrieved, only eight observational studies were included, resulting in a total sample size of 4055 patients. It was found that 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25(OH)D) levels did not show any significant difference between patients with and without ED. However, when patients with vitamin D deficiency only were taken into account, the international index of erectile function (IIEF) score for erectile dysfunction was significantly worse than in controls. This association remained significant even when eugonadal-only patients were considered. Finally, we found that eugonadal patients with severe ED have lower 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels than patients with mild ED. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests an association between vitamin D deficiency and the presence of severe forms of ED, independent of testicular function.",is there an association between vitamin D deficiency and erectile dysfunction?,"This suggests an association between vitamin D deficiency and the presence of severe forms of ED, independent of testicular function."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25402637/,Do ketogenic diets really suppress appetite? A systematic review and meta-analysis YES,25402637,2015-01-01,"Very-low-energy diets (VLEDs) and ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets (KLCDs) are two dietary strategies that have been associated with a suppression of appetite. However, the results of clinical trials investigating the effect of ketogenic diets on appetite are inconsistent. To evaluate quantitatively the effect of ketogenic diets on subjective appetite ratings, we conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of studies that assessed appetite with visual analogue scales before (in energy balance) and during (while in ketosis) adherence to VLED or KLCD. Individuals were less hungry and exhibited greater fullness/satiety while adhering to VLED, and individuals adhering to KLCD were less hungry and had a reduced desire to eat. Although these absolute changes in appetite were small, they occurred within the context of energy restriction, which is known to increase appetite in obese people. Thus, the clinical benefit of a ketogenic diet is in preventing an increase in appetite, despite weight loss, although individuals may indeed feel slightly less hungry (or more full or satisfied). Ketosis appears to provide a plausible explanation for this suppression of appetite. Future studies should investigate the minimum level of ketosis required to achieve appetite suppression during ketogenic weight loss diets, as this could enable inclusion of a greater variety of healthy carbohydrate-containing foods into the diet.",Do ketogenic diets really suppress appetite?,"The clinical benefit of a ketogenic diet is in preventing an increase in appetite, despite weight loss, although individuals may indeed feel slightly less hungry (or more full or satisfied).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26443336/,Is consuming yoghurt associated with weight management outcomes? Results from a systematic review YES,26443336,2016-05-01,"BACKGROUND:
Yoghurt is part of the diet of many people worldwide and is commonly recognised as a 'health food'. Epidemiological studies suggest that yoghurt may be useful as part of weight management programs. In the absence of comprehensive systematic reviews, this systematic review investigated the effect of yoghurt consumption by apparently healthy adults on weight-related outcomes.

METHODS:
An extensive literature search was undertaken, as part of a wider scoping review, to identify yoghurt studies. A total of 13 631 records were assessed for their relevance to weight-related outcomes.

RESULTS:
Twenty-two publications were eligible according to the review protocol. Cohort studies (n=6) and cross-sectional studies (n=7) all showed a correlation between yoghurt and lower or improved body weight/composition. Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one controlled trial had various limitations, including small size and short duration. One RCT showed significant effects of yoghurt on weight loss, but was confounded by differences in calcium intake. One trial showed nonsignificant weight gain and the remaining five trials showed nonsignificant weight losses that were greater in yoghurt consumers.

CONCLUSIONS:
Yoghurt consumption is associated with lower body mass index, lower body weight/weight gain, smaller waist circumference and lower body fat in epidemiological studies. RCTs suggest weight reduction effects, but do not permit determination of a cause-effect relationship. Well-controlled, adequately powered trials in research and community settings appear likely to identify a modest but beneficial effect of yoghurt consumption for prevention of weight gain and management of obesity. The ready availability of yoghurt (a nutrient-dense food) and its ease of introduction to most diets suggests that educating the public to eat yoghurt as part of a balanced and healthy diet may potentially contribute to improved public health. Future carefully designed RCTs could provide proof of principle and large community-based studies could determine the practical impact of yoghurt on body weight/composition.",Is consuming yoghurt associated with weight management outcomes?,"Yoghurt consumption is associated with lower body mass index, lower body weight/weight gain, smaller waist circumference and lower body fat in epidemiological studies.

Olive oil is considered one of the key nutritional components responsible for the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by the use of olive oil in meals as the main source of fat; a high consumption of water, fruits, nuts, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, spices, and herbs; a moderate consumption of dairy products (mainly cheese and yogurt), fish, poultry, and red wine; and a reduced consumption of red meat and processed foods. The aim of this review was to summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials on the effect of regular dietary intake of olive oil on three inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Reviewed RCTs reveal beneficial effects of olive oil by reducing levels of inflammation markers. Olive oil taken on a regular basis can be a good dietary fat alternative, especially to manage IL-6.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32290868/,Are ketogenic diets promising for Alzheimer's disease? A translational review YES,32290868,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND:
Brain amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with complex neuroinflammatory reactions such as microglial activation and cytokine production. Glucose metabolism is closely related to neuroinflammation. Ketogenic diets (KDs) include a high amount of fat, low carbohydrate and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) intake. KDs lead to the production of ketone bodies to fuel the brain, in the absence of glucose. These nutritional interventions are validated treatments of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, consequently leading to a better intellectual development in epileptic children. In neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline, potential benefits of KD were previously pointed out, but the published evidence remains scarce. The main objective of this review was to critically examine the evidence regarding KD or MCT intake effects both in AD and ageing animal models and in humans.

MAIN BODY:
We conducted a review based on a systematic search of interventional trials published from January 2000 to March 2019 found on MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. Overall, 11 animal and 11 human studies were included in the present review. In preclinical studies, this review revealed an improvement of cognition and motor function in AD mouse model and ageing animals. However, the KD and ketone supplementation were also associated with significant weight loss. In human studies, most of the published articles showed a significant improvement of cognitive outcomes (global cognition, memory and executive functions) with ketone supplementation or KD, regardless of the severity of cognitive impairments previously detected. Both interventions seemed acceptable and efficient to achieve ketosis.

CONCLUSION:
The KD or MCT intake might be promising ways to alter cognitive symptoms in AD, especially at the prodromal stage of the disease. The need for efficient disease-modifying strategies suggests to pursue further KD interventional studies to assess the efficacy, the adherence to this diet and the potential adverse effects of these nutritional approaches.",Are ketogenic diets promising for Alzheimer's disease?,"The KD or MCT intake might be promising ways to alter cognitive symptoms in AD, especially at the prodromal stage of the disease.

Food fortification as part of the food-first approach in nursing homes is a strategy that may increase energy and protein intake.

OBJECTIVES:
This review aimed to determine the effect of nutrition interventions using fortification, nutrient-dense or enriched food and/or drinks on energy and protein intake in residents living in nursing homes, compared to the standard menu with or without oral nutritional support products. The secondary aim was to identify and synthesise outcomes of these interventions on weight change, nutritional status, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit.

METHODS:
A systematic search of seven databases was undertaken. After reviewing all titles/abstracts then full-text papers, key data were extracted and synthesised narratively and through meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research.

RESULTS:
Of 3,098 articles retrieved, 16 were included, 13 in the meta-analysis. There were 891 participants, with the study duration ranging from four to 26 weeks. The groups receiving the fortified diet had a significantly higher energy intake (Hedges' g = 0.69 (CI 0.36-1.03), p < 0.0001) and protein intake (Hedges' g = 0.46 (CI 0.17-0.74), p = 0.003) compared with the groups receiving the standard menu +/- ONS. The meta-analysis revealed I<sup>2</sup> values of 77% for energy (p < 0.0001) and 60% for protein (p = 0.003), indicating considerable statistical heterogeneity across included studies. Benefits to weight and nutritional status of residents were recorded in some studies. Where reported, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of menu fortification/supplementation were variable.

CONCLUSIONS:
This systematic review with meta-analyses has shown that fortified menus may significantly increase energy and protein intakes compared with standard menus in nursing homes. As such, the findings of this review support further use of fortified diets in this setting. Further research is warranted comparing food fortification to standard menus, with a particular focus on evaluating the effect on weight, nutritional status and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

A Systematic Review YES,26891320,2016-02-16,"Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutrient deficiency within the developed world. This is of concern as ID has been shown to affect immunity, thermoregulation, work performance and cognition. Animal flesh foods provide the richest and most bioavailable source of dietary (haem) iron, however, it is unclear whether low animal flesh diets contribute to ID. This systematic review aimed to investigate whether a higher consumption of animal flesh foods is associated with better iron status in adults. CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched for published studies that included adults (≥18 years) from developed countries and measured flesh intakes in relation to iron status indices. Eight experimental and 41 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Generally, studies varied in population and study designs and results were conflicting. Of the seven high quality studies, five showed a positive association between animal flesh intake (85-300 g/day) and iron status. However, the optimum quantity or frequency of flesh intake required to maintain or achieve a healthy iron status remains unclear.

Diet plays a key role in growth and should optimally supply all required nutrients to support the growth. While millets (defined broadly to include sorghum) are traditional foods, and climate smart nutritious crops, which are grown across Africa and Asia, they have not been mainstreamed like rice, wheat, and maize. Diversifying staples with millets can potentially provide more macro and micro nutrients, compared to the mainstream crops. However, there is little known scientific evidence to prove millets' efficacy on growth. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to collate evidence of the benefits of millets in improving the growth of children. Eight eligible randomized feeding trials were included in the meta-analysis. Results from the randomized effect model showed a significant effect (<i>p</i> < 0.05) of millet-based diets on mean height (+28.2%) (<i>n</i> = 8), weight (<i>n</i> = 9) (+26%), mid upper arm circumference (<i>n</i> = 5) (+39%) and chest circumference (<i>n</i> = 5) (+37%) in comparison to regular rice-based diets over for the period of 3 months to 4.5 years, which was based on largely substituting rice with millets. When an enhanced and diverse diet was served, replacing rice with millet had only minimal growth improvement on chest circumference (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The quality assessment using GRADE shows that the evidence used for this systematic review and meta-analysis had moderate quality, based on eight scoring criteria. These results demonstrate the value of adding millet as the staple for undernourished communities. Further understanding of the efficacy of millets on growth in a wider range of diets is important to develop appropriate dietary programs and improve the nutritional status of various age groups across Africa and Asia.",Can feeding a millet-based diet improve the growth of children?,"Results showed a significant effect of millet-based diets on mean height, weight, mid upper arm circumference and chest circumference in comparison to regular rice-based diets over for the period of 3 months to 4.5 years, which was based on largely substituting rice with millets.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29322564/,Can fortified foods and snacks increase the energy and protein intake of hospitalised older patients? A systematic review YES,29322564,2018-01-10,"BACKGROUND:
Undernutrition affects over 44% of hospitalised older people, who often dislike oral nutritional supplements (ONS). This review summarises the evidence for an alternative strategy, using energy and protein dense meals (via fortification) or snacks (supplementation) to increase the dietary energy and protein intake of older inpatients.

METHODS:
A search was conducted through PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews (May 1996 to May 2016) that used fortification or supplementation to increase the energy or protein intake of patients (mean age ≥60 years) in hospitals or rehabilitation centres.

RESULTS:
Ten articles (546 patients, mean age 60-83 years) were identified. Compared with usual nutritional care, six studies using either energy or protein based fortification and supplementation significantly increased intake of energy (250-450 kcal day<sup>-1</sup> ) or protein (12-16 g day<sup>-1</sup> ). Two studies enriched menus with both energy and protein, and significantly increased both energy (698 kcal day<sup>-1</sup> and 21 kJ kg<sup>-1</sup> ) and protein (16 g and 0.2 g kg<sup>-1</sup> ) intake compared to usual care. ONS was similar to supplementation in one study but superior to fortification in another. Four studies reported good acceptability of enriched products and two studies that found they were cost-effective.

CONCLUSIONS:
Compared with usual nutritional care, energy- and protein-based fortification and supplementation could be employed as an effective, well-tolerated and cost-effective intervention to improve dietary intake amongst older inpatients. This strategy may be particularly useful for patients with cognitive impairment who struggle with ONS, and clinical trials are required to compare these approaches and establish their impact on functional outcomes.",Can fortified foods and snacks increase the energy and protein intake of hospitalised older patients?,"Compared with usual nutritional care, energy- and protein-based fortification and supplementation could be employed as an effective, well-tolerated and cost-effective intervention to improve dietary intake amongst older inpatients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32330226/,Can Improved Legume Varieties Optimize Iron Status in Low- and Middle-Income Countries? A Systematic Review YES,32330226,2020-09-01,"Iron and zinc deficiencies are some of the most widespread micronutrient deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Dietary diversification, food fortification, nutrition education, and supplementation can be used to control micronutrient deficiencies. Legumes are important staple foods in most households in LMIC. Legumes are highly nutritious (good sources of essential minerals, fiber, and low glycemic index) and offer potential benefits in addressing nutrition insecurity in LMIC. Several efforts have been made to increase micronutrient intake by use of improved legumes. Improved legumes have a higher nutrient bioavailability, lower phytate, or reduced hard-to-cook (HTC) defect. We hypothesize that consumption of improved legumes leads to optimization of zinc and iron status and associated health outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this review is to examine the evidence on the efficacy of interventions using improved legumes. Nine relevant studies are included in the review. Consumption of improved legumes resulted in a ≥1.5-fold increase in iron intake. Several studies noted modest improvements in biomarkers of iron status [hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF), and transferrin receptor] associated with consumption of improved legumes. Currently, no efficacy studies assessing the relation between consumption of improved legumes and zinc status are available in the literature. Evidence shows that, in addition to repletion of biomarkers of iron status, consumption of improved legumes is associated with both clinical and functional outcomes. The prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) decreases with consumption of improved legumes, with increases of ≤3.0 g/L in Hb concentrations. Improvement in cognition and brain function in women has been reported as well. However, further research is necessary in more at-risk groups and also to show if the reported improvements in status markers translate to improved health outcomes. Evidence from the included studies shows potential from consumption of improved legumes suggesting them to be a sustainable solution to improve iron status.",Can improved legume varieties optimize iron status in low- and middle-income countries?,"Evidence shows that, in addition to repletion of biomarkers of iron status, consumption of improved legumes is associated with both clinical and functional outcomes.

Many micronutrients might play a key role in dental implant osseointegration by influencing some alveolar bone parameters, such as healing of the alveolus after tooth extraction. This scoping review aims to summarize the role of dietary supplements in optimizing osseointegration after implant insertion surgery. A technical expert panel (TEP) of 11 medical specialists with expertise in oral surgery, bone metabolism, nutrition, and orthopedic surgery performed the review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) model. The TEP identified micronutrients from the ""European Union (EU) Register of nutrition and health claims made on foods"" that have a relationship with bone and tooth health, and planned a PubMed search, selecting micronutrients previously identified as MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and adding to each of them the words ""dental implants"" and ""osseointegration"". The TEP identified 19 studies concerning vitamin D, magnesium, resveratrol, vitamin C, a mixture of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D, and synthetic bone mineral. However, several micronutrients are non-authorized by the ""EU Register on nutrition and health claims"" for improving bone and/or tooth health.

To evaluate what is known about the relative health impacts, in terms of nutrient intake and health outcomes, of diets with reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE).

DESIGN:
We systematically reviewed the results of published studies that link GHGE of dietary patterns to nutritional content or associated consequences for health.

SETTING:
We included studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that included data on actual and modelled diets and enabled a matched comparison of GHGE with nutrient composition and/or health outcomes.

SUBJECTS:
Studies included used data from subjects from the general population, who had taken part in dietary surveys or prospective cohort studies.

RESULTS:
We identified sixteen eligible studies, with data on 100 dietary patterns. We present the results as dietary links between GHGE reduction and impact on nutrients to limit (n 151), micronutrient content (n 158) and health outcomes (n 25). The results were highly heterogeneous. Across all measures of 'healthiness', 64 % (n 214) of dietary links show that reduced GHGE from diets were associated with worse health indicators. However, some trends emerged. In particular, reduced saturated fat and salt are often associated with reduced GHGE in diets that are low in animal products (57/84). Yet these diets are also often high in sugar (38/55) and low in essential micronutrients (129/158).

Anemia, iron deficiency, and iodine deficiency are problems of important public health concern in many parts of the world, with consequences for the health, development, and work capacity of populations. Several countries are beginning to implement double fortified salt (DFS) programs to simultaneously address iodine and iron deficiencies.

OBJECTIVE:
Our objective was to summarize the evidence for efficacy and effectiveness of DFS on the full range of status and functional outcomes and across different implementation and evaluation designs essential to successful interventions.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and gray literature examining the effects of DFS on nutritional status, cognition, work productivity, development, and morbidity of all population groups. We searched for articles in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register, and ProQuest for randomized trials, quasi-randomized trials, and program effectiveness evaluations.

RESULTS:
A total of 22 studies (N individuals = 52,758) were included. Efficacy studies indicated a significant overall positive effect on hemoglobin concentration [standardized mean difference (95% CI): 0.33 (0.18, 0.48)], ferritin [0.42 (0.08, 0.76)], anemia [risk ratio (95% CI): 0.80 (0.70, 0.92)], and iron deficiency anemia [0.36 (0.24, 0.55)]. Effects on urinary iodine concentration were not significantly different between DFS and iodized salt. The impact on functional outcomes was mixed. Only 2 effectiveness studies were identified. They reported programmatic challenges including low coverage, suboptimal DFS quality, and storage constraints.

CONCLUSIONS:
Given the biological benefits of DFS across several populations in efficacy research, additional evaluations of robust DFS programs delivered at scale, which consider effective implementation and measure appropriate biomarkers, are needed.","Can double fortification of salt with iron and iodine reduce anemia, iron deficiency anemia, iron deficiency, iodine deficiency, and functional outcomes?","Given the biological benefits of DFS across several populations in efficacy research, additional evaluations of robust DFS programs delivered at scale, which consider effective implementation and measure appropriate biomarkers, are needed."

The role of nutrition in the respiratory and immune systems has been studied in some studies, and its importance is undeniable. In addition, one of the key findings in this disease is high inflammation that affects almost all patients. This systematic narrative review aims to answer the question, ""Can an anti-inflammatory diet be effective in preventing or treating viral respiratory diseases?"" A systematic review search was used for the articles extraction. All studies published in English from 1999 to 2020 investigating dietary inflammatory conditions and RVI were included.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15351198/,Atkins and other low-carbohydrate diets: hoax or an effective tool for weight loss?,15351198,2004-09-01,"CONTEXT:
The Atkins diet books have sold more than 45 million copies over 40 years, and in the obesity epidemic this diet and accompanying Atkins food products are popular. The diet claims to be effective at producing weight loss despite ad-libitum consumption of fatty meat, butter, and other high-fat dairy products, restricting only the intake of carbohydrates to under 30 g a day. Low-carbohydrate diets have been regarded as fad diets, but recent research questions this view.

STARTING POINT:
A systematic review of low-carbohydrate diets found that the weight loss achieved is associated with the duration of the diet and restriction of energy intake, but not with restriction of carbohydrates. Two groups have reported longer-term randomised studies that compared instruction in the low-carbohydrate diet with a low-fat calorie-reduced diet in obese patients (N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 2082-90; Ann Intern Med 2004; 140: 778-85). Both trials showed better weight loss on the low-carbohydrate diet after 6 months, but no difference after 12 months. WHERE NEXT?: The apparent paradox that ad-libitum intake of high-fat foods produces weight loss might be due to severe restriction of carbohydrate depleting glycogen stores, leading to excretion of bound water, the ketogenic nature of the diet being appetite suppressing, the high protein-content being highly satiating and reducing spontaneous food intake, or limited food choices leading to decreased energy intake. Long-term studies are needed to measure changes in nutritional status and body composition during the low-carbohydrate diet, and to assess fasting and postprandial cardiovascular risk factors and adverse effects. Without that information, low-carbohydrate diets cannot be recommended.",Are Atkins and other low-carbohydrate diets a hoax or an effective tool for weight loss?,"The apparent paradox that ad-libitum intake of high-fat foods produces weight loss might be due to severe restriction of carbohydrate depleting glycogen stores, leading to excretion of bound water, the ketogenic nature of the diet being appetite suppressing, the high protein-content being highly satiating and reducing spontaneous food intake, or limited food choices leading to decreased energy intake.

A Systematic Review,36079848,2022-08-31,"During the complementary feeding period, any nutritional deficiencies may negatively impact infant growth and neurodevelopment. A healthy diet containing all essential nutrients is strongly recommended by the WHO during infancy. Because vegetarian diets are becoming increasingly popular in many industrialized countries, some parents ask the pediatrician for a vegetarian diet, partially or entirely free of animal-source foods, for their children from an early age. This systematic review aims to evaluate the evidence on how vegetarian complementary feeding impacts infant growth, neurodevelopment, risk of wasted and/or stunted growth, overweight and obesity. The SR was registered with PROSPERO 2021 (CRD 42021273592). A comprehensive search strategy was adopted to search and find all relevant studies. For ethical reasons, there are no interventional studies assessing the impact of non-supplemented vegetarian/vegan diets on the physical and neurocognitive development of children, but there are numerous studies that have analyzed the effects of dietary deficiencies on individual nutrients. Based on current evidence, vegetarian and vegan diets during the complementary feeding period have not been shown to be safe, and the current best evidence suggests that the risk of critical micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies and growth retardation is high: they may result in significantly different outcomes in neuropsychological development and growth when compared with a healthy omnivorous diet such as the Mediterranean Diet.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Control Trials",37242133,2023-05-09,"The effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet (MD) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects has been evaluated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the overall effects of MD intervention in a cohort of NAFLD patients targeting specific markers such as central obesity, lipid profile, liver enzymes and fibrosis, and intrahepatic fat (IHF). Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus were explored to collect relevant studies from the last 10 years. RCTs with NAFLD subjects were included in this systematic review with a mean intervention duration from 6 weeks to 1 year, and different intervention strategies, mainly including energy restriction MD (normal or low glycaemic index), low-fat MD with increased monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and increased exercise expenditure. The outcomes measured in this meta-analysis were gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), waist circumference (WC), and liver fibrosis. Ten randomized controlled trials, which involved a total of 737 adults with NAFLD, were included. According to the results, the MD seems to decrease the liver stiffness (kPa) by -0.42 (CI95% -0.92, 0.09) (<i>p</i> = 0.10) and significantly reduce the TC by -0.46 mg/dl (CI95% -0.55, -0.38) (<i>p</i> = 0.001), while no significant findings were documented for liver enzymes and WC among patients with NAFLD. In conclusion, the MD might reduce indirect and direct outcomes linked with NAFLD severity, such as TC, liver fibrosis, and WC, although it is important to consider the variations across trials. Further RCTs are necessary to corroborate the findings obtained and provide further evidence on the role of the MD in the modulation of other disorders related to NAFLD.","Does the Mediterranean Diet have any effect on lipid profile, central obesity and liver enzymes in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects?","In conclusion, the MD might reduce indirect and direct outcomes linked with NAFLD severity, such as TC, liver fibrosis, and WC, although it is important to consider the variations across trials.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29480736/,Are Isolated and Complex Fiber Supplements Good Choices for Weight Management? A Systematic Review,29480736,2017-11-01,"BACKGROUND:
Previous trials have reported beneficial effects of isolated and complex fiber supplements in obesity treatment. However, recommending fiber supplements in obese subjects remains controversial. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has updated the data on the effects of fiber supplements on obesity since 2010 and the need exists for a systematic review on this topic. Accordingly, a systematic review was undertaken to summarize the efficacy of different types of fiber supplements as a complementary treatment for weight management.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar between January 2010 to August 2016 with no language restriction. Considering the inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment score, finally 17 clinical trials met the eligibility criteria and were included.

RESULTS:
The present study indicated that the efficacy of various fiber supplements on losing weight is variable. Several mechanisms related to physicochemical properties of fibers such as solubility, fermentability and viscosity rates can be involved in their anti-obesity effects. Dextrin, Mannan (gum Arabic) and pectin-rich fiber (lupin kernel) with no dietary interventions indicated a reduction in body weight and energy intake, while from clinical point of view, their effects were not considerable.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, findings indicated that the efficacy of fiber supplements on obesity management is dependent on their contents and physicochemical properties. It seems that fiber supplements with no weight-loss interventions did not have considerable antiobesity effects. However, due to limited studies on each type of fiber, findings should be declared by caution. Additional research is needed on comparison of different fiber supplements in similar conditions to clarify the best type and dosage of fiber supplement as a complementary therapy in obesity management.",Are isolated and complex fiber supplements good choices for weight management?,"Overall, findings indicated that the efficacy of fiber supplements on obesity management is dependent on their contents and physicochemical properties.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of athletes using ergogenic aids. In this context, scientific evidence must play a prominent role in either endorsing or warning against the use of these products, ensuring the preservation of health while promoting the theoretically established positive benefits. In this vein, beetroot juice (BJ) stands out as a key supplement as an ergogenic aid to improve sports performance, given its demonstrated influence on both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. However, despite widespread global demand, there remains a lack of understanding regarding the potential synergistic effects of combining BJ with other supplements. Consequently, our study aims to determine whether the combination of BJ with another nutritional supplement can enhance its beneficial effects and, therefore, optimize physical performance in humans. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in two major databases-Web of Science and PubMed-from 1 January 2018 to 29 January 2023, using specific keywords. After the exclusion criteria, six articles were selected for analysis. Therefore, our study shows that the effectiveness of combining BJ with another supplement mainly depends on the duration of the chronic intervention, which is where the greatest benefits have been observed.",Does co-supplementation with beetroot juice and other nutritional supplements positively impact sports performance?,"Our findings show that the effectiveness of combining BJ with another supplement mainly depends on the duration of the chronic intervention, which is where the greatest benefits have been observed."

Earlier reviews of (multiple) micronutrient interventions in school-age children did not distinguish between supplementation or fortification studies. The present review includes studies that tested the impact of multiple micronutrients provided via fortification on the micronutrient status, growth, health, and cognitive development of schoolchildren. Twelve eligible studies were identified. Eleven of them tested the effects of multiple micronutrients provided via fortified food compared to unfortified food. One study compared fortification with multiple micronutrients to fortification with iodine alone.

The purpose of the present systematic review was to synthesize evidence from the literature to assess efficacy of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in childhood asthma. Design/Setting A systematic search of six databases, three clinical trial registries and hand-search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted up to 29 October 2016. Inclusion criteria included exposure to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, measurement of asthma symptoms and study population of children aged <18 years. Quality assessment was conducted. Due to significant heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not feasible.

RESULTS:
Of the 436 articles identified, after removal of duplicates and based on inclusion criteria, fifteen observational studies conducted in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries were relevant. No randomized controlled trials were retrieved. Twelve studies reported an inverse association between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and asthma in children, two studies showed no association and one study showed an increase in asthma symptoms. In fourteen out of fifteen studies, quality assessment checks revealed good reliability and validity among study methodologies.

High consumption of fried foods might increase the risk of these disorders. However, it is not clear whether the use of vegetables oils for cooking increases the risk of chronic diseases. We systematically searched for published studies that assessed the association between vegetable oil consumption including fried food consumption and the risk of overweight/obesity or weight gain, T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, and CVD or hypertension in the following databases: PubMed; Web of Science; Google Scholar.

To assess the totality of the evidence testing the null hypothesis that LES exposure (versus sugars or unsweetened alternatives) has no effect on EI or BW, we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies in animals and humans consuming LES with ad libitum access to food energy. In 62 of 90 animal studies exposure to LES did not affect or decreased BW. Of 28 reporting increased BW, 19 compared LES with glucose exposure using a specific 'learning' paradigm. Twelve prospective cohort studies in humans reported inconsistent associations between LES use and body mass index (-0.002 kg m(-)(2) per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.009 to 0.005). Meta-analysis of short-term randomized controlled trials (129 comparisons) showed reduced total EI for LES versus sugar-sweetened food or beverage consumption before an ad libitum meal (-94 kcal, 95% CI -122 to -66), with no difference versus water (-2 kcal, 95% CI -30 to 26). This was consistent with EI results from sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (10 comparisons). Meta-analysis of sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (4 weeks to 40 months) showed that consumption of LES versus sugar led to relatively reduced BW (nine comparisons; -1.35 kg, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.42), and a similar relative reduction in BW versus water (three comparisons; -1.24 kg, 95% CI -2.22 to -0.26). Most animal studies did not mimic LES consumption by humans, and reverse causation may influence the results of prospective cohort studies. The preponderance of evidence from all human randomized controlled trials indicates that LES do not increase EI or BW, whether compared with caloric or non-caloric (for example, water) control conditions.

Although a considerable number of studies have illustrated the positive effects of fresh fruits on metabolic status, the impacts of fruits on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are inconsistent. In consideration of this issue, we aimed to systematically summarize the findings of cohort studies with respect to the link between fresh fruits and the risk of GDM.

METHOD:
We selected cohort studies with English language indexed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase from 2000 to 31 January 2018. To examine the link between fresh fruits and the risk of GDM development, relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest versus the lowest consumption of fruits were pooled using a random effect model and the DerSimonian and Laird method.

RESULTS:
Out of 2522 publications, finally 5 cohort studies were obtained.

Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that viscous dietary fiber may offer beneficial effects on glycemic control and, thus, an improved cardiovascular disease risk profile. Our purpose was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to synthesize the therapeutic effect of viscous fiber supplementation on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through 15 June 2018. We included RCTs ≥3 weeks in duration that assessed the effects of viscous fiber on markers of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted data.

Functional gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, distension, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence have been noted in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The diversity of symptoms has meant that finding an effective treatment has been challenging with most treatments alleviating only the primary symptom. A novel treatment option for IBS and IBD currently generating much excitement is the low fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the evidence of the efficacy of such a diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were searched through to March 2015 to identify relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the effect of a low FODMAP diet on the reduction in IBS [Symptoms Severity Score (SSS)] score and increase in IBS quality of life (QOL) score for both randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized interventions using a random-effects model.

RESULTS:
Six RCTs and 16 non-randomized interventions were included in the analysis. There was a significant decrease in IBS SSS scores for those individuals on a low FODMAP diet in both the RCTs (OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.25-0.76; I (2) = 35.52, p = 0.00) and non-randomized interventions (OR 0.03, 95 % CI 0.01-0.2; I (2) = 69.1, p = 0.02). In addition, there was a significant improvement in the IBS-QOL score for RCTs (OR 1.84, 95 % CI 1.12-3.03; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.39) and for non-randomized interventions (OR 3.18, 95 % CI 1.60-6.31; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.89). Further, following a low FODMAP diet was found to significantly reduce symptom severity for abdominal pain (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.13-2.88; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.56), bloating (OR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.07-2.87; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.45) and overall symptoms (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.11-2.95; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.4) in the RCTs. In the non-randomized interventions similar findings were observed.

CONCLUSION:

Several epidemiological investigations have assessed the association between vegetable-based diet intake (VDI) and risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal subjects (OPS), but the outcomes have been inconsistent. We performed a review of the updated literature to evaluate this correlation.

METHODS:
We searched for relevant studies published in September 2018 or earlier. Two researchers conducted eligibility assessment and data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved through consultation with a third expert. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS:
Ten studies, which included 14,247 subjects, were identified. On comparing the highest category of VDI consumption with the lowest category of VDI consumption, the pooled OR for OPS was 0.73 (95% CI = 0.57-0.95), i.e., participants with a higher intake of vegetables had a 27% (95% CI = 5-43%) lower risk of OPS. Significant benefits were found on subgroup analyses of case-control studies (OR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.48-0.78]), but not on subgroup analyses of cross-sectional studies (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.57-1.16]). The synthesized effect estimates were in the direction of decreased risk of OPS on subgroup analyses of the femoral region (OR, 0.57, 95% CI = 0.41-0.80) and the lumbar spine (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38-0.81), but not on subgroup analyses of the calcaneus (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.33-2.16) and the lumbar and/or femoral region (OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.79-1.38). Positive results were observed on pooled analyses of the Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurement method (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54-0.95]), but not on pooled analyses of the Standardized Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) measurement method (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.33-2.16]). This might have resulted from a type II error due to wide confidence intervals and less number of included studies.

CONCLUSION:
This meta-analysis seemingly confirms that higher consumption of VDI was associated with a lower risk of OPS. Taken together, these results highlight the need for future high-quality design-based trials on quantified vegetable intake and OPS.",Can increasing the prevalence of vegetable-based diets lower the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal subjects? ,"These studies seemingly confirm that higher consumption of VDI was associated with a lower risk of OPS.

Although much is known about the association between dietary glycemic load (GL) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), prospective cohort studies have not consistently shown a positive dose-response relation.

OBJECTIVE:
We performed a comprehensive examination of evidence on the dose response that links GL to T2D and sources of heterogeneity among all prospective cohort studies on healthy adults available in the literature.

DESIGN:
We conducted a systematic review of all prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses to quantify the GL-T2D relation both without and with adjustment for covariates.

RESULTS:
Among 24 prospective cohort studies identified by August 2012, the GL ranged from ∼60 to ∼280 g per daily intake of 2000 kcal (8.4 MJ). In a fully adjusted meta-analysis model, the GL was positively associated with RR of T2D of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.31, 1.61) for a 100-g increment in GL (P < 0.001; n = 24 studies; 7.5 million person-years of follow-up). Sex (P = 0.03), dietary instrument validity (P < 0.001), and ethnicity (European American compared with other; P = 0.04) together explained 97% of the heterogeneity among studies. After adjustment for heterogeneities, we used both funnel and trim-and-fill analyses to identify a negligible publication bias. Multiple influence, cumulative, and forecast analyses indicated that the GL-T2D relation tended to have reached stability and to have been underestimated. The relation was apparent at all doses of GL investigated, although it was statistically significant only at >95 g GL/2000 kcal.

CONCLUSION:
After we accounted for several sources of heterogeneity, findings from prospective cohort studies that related the GL to T2D appear robust and consistently indicate strong and significantly lower T2D risk in persons who consume lower-GL diets.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29439068/,Does high-carbohydrate intake lead to increased risk of obesity? A systematic review and meta-analysis,29439068,2018-02-08,"OBJECTIVES:
The present study aimed to test the association between high and low carbohydrate diets and obesity, and second, to test the link between total carbohydrate intake (as a percentage of total energy intake) and obesity.

SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES:
We sought MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar for observation studies published between January 1990 and December 2016 assessing an association between obesity and high-carbohydrate intake. Two independent reviewers selected candidate studies, extracted data and assessed study quality.

RESULTS:
The study identified 22 articles that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and quantified an association between carbohydrate intake and obesity. The first pooled strata (high-carbohydrate versus low-carbohydrate intake) suggested a weak increased risk of obesity. The second pooled strata (increasing percentage of total carbohydrate intake in daily diet) showed a weak decreased risk of obesity. Both these pooled strata estimates were, however, not statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS:
On the basis of the current study, it cannot be concluded that a high-carbohydrate diet or increased percentage of total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates increases the odds of obesity. A central limitation of the study was the non-standard classification of dietary intake across the studies, as well as confounders like total energy intake, activity levels, age and gender. Further studies are needed that specifically classify refined versus unrefined carbohydrate intake, as well as studies that investigate the relationship between high fat, high unrefined carbohydrate-sugar diets.

The goal of this review was to provide an update on the literature examining how voluntary, temporary abstention from eating impacts cognitive function.

RECENT FINDINGS:
We evaluated peer-reviewed articles published between August 2013 and January 2021 that assessed adults, included a measure of cognitive functioning with neutral stimuli, and compared individuals in a fasted state to individuals in a fed state (either within- or between-subject designs). Nineteen articles (21 studies) met inclusion criteria. Sample sizes, fasting methods, and tasks varied across studies. Review of studies indicated that fasting was associated with deficits in cognitive functioning; few studies indicated a benefit in cognitive functioning following a single voluntary fast. The heterogeneity and rarity of available studies limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Several crucial psychosocial and sociodemographic moderators remain unexplored.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Ashwagandha supplementation on anxiety as well as stress. A systematic search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception until December 2021. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigate the effect of Ashwagandha extract on anxiety and stress. The overall effect size was pooled by random-effects model and the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for outcomes were applied. Overall, 12 eligible papers with a total sample size of 1,002 participants and age range between 25 and 48 years were included in the current systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that Ashwagandha supplementation significantly reduced anxiety (SMD: -1.55, 95% CI: -2.37, -0.74; p = .005; I<sup>2</sup>  = 93.8%) and stress level (SMD: -1.75; 95% CI: -2.29, -1.22; p = .005; I<sup>2</sup>  = 83.1%) compared to the placebo. Additionally, the non-linear dose-response analysis indicated a favorable effect of Ashwagandha supplementation on anxiety until 12,000 mg/d and stress at dose of 300-600 mg/d.

Potential mechanisms, particularly the impact of added sugar intake on appetite, warrant exploration. A systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials investigated the association between added sugar consumption and appetite in overweight and obese adults. A systematic search of Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science and CINAHL included studies that examined the relationship between added sugar intake and appetite markers, in comparison with a group with lower added sugar intake. A total of twenty-one articles describing nineteen studies were included in the review. The effect of added sugar on appetite was explored separately by reported comparisons of added sugar type and their effect to three study outcomes: energy consumption (n 20 comparisons); satiety (n 18); and appetite hormones, leptin (n 4) or ghrelin (n 7). Increased added sugar consumption did not impact subsequent energy intake (n 9), nor did it influence satiety (n 12) or ghrelin levels (n 4). Differences in the total daily energy intake were comparable with the differences in energy values of tested products (n 3). Added sugar intake was reported to increase leptin levels (n 3). This review did not find a consistent relationship between added sugar intake and appetite measures, which may be partially explained by variations in study methodologies.

Recurrent disease is attributed to tumor adaptation to survive, despite lower circulating androgen concentrations, making the blockage of downstream androgen signaling a chemotherapeutic goal for PCa. Dietary intake of tomato and its predominant carotenoid, lycopene, reduce the risk for PCa, and preclinical studies have shown promising results that tomato and lycopene can inhibit androgen signaling in normal prostate tissue. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate whether mechanistic evidence exists to support the hypothesis that tomato or lycopene interact with the androgen axis in PCa. Eighteen studies (<i>n</i> = 5 in vivo; <i>n</i> = 13 in vitro) were included in the final review. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible due to variability of the data; however, the overall estimated directions of effect for the compared studies were visually represented by albatross plots.

Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) has a structure similar to whole grains and contains phytochemicals and dietary fiber. Hence, it is considered a food substance with a high nutritional value.

OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of quinoa in reducing fasting blood glucose (FBG), body weight (BW), and body mass index (BMI) in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.

METHODS:
A comprehensive search in ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases as well as Google Scholar, was conducted up to November 2022 to identify reports of randomized clinical trials that investigated the effect of quinoa on FBG, BW, and BMI.

RESULTS:
Seven trials comprising 258 adults with mean ages of 31 to 64 years were included in this review. Studies used 15 to 50 grams of quinoa/per day as an intervention, and the intervention was between 28 to 180 days. In a dose-response analysis of FBG, there was significant evidence of a nonlinear association between intervention and FBG based on the quadratic model (P-value for nonlinearity = 0.027); hence, the slope of the curve increased when quinoa intake was nearly 25 g/- day.

There were no significant changes in adiponectin (Hedges' g = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.27, 0.19) and leptin (Hedges' g = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.86, 0.26) in probiotic group compared with controls. Subgroup analyses ranged in heterogeneity from 0% to 93%, but no subgroup showed an effect of probiotics on adiponectin or leptin.

CONCLUSION:
There were limited studies regarding the effect of prebiotic and synbiotic on adiponectin and leptin. Although previous studies reported several health promoting effects of probiotics, we could not find any pooled effect on adiponectin and leptin.","Do probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics affect adiponectin and leptin in adults?","There were limited studies regarding the effect of prebiotic and synbiotic on adiponectin and leptin.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,33724127,2021-03-16,"Several pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical approaches have been suggested to improve liver health. There is a large discrepancy in the effects of saffron supplementation on liver function in adults. To fill this knowledge gap, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assess the effects of saffron supplementation on liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). A systematic search current to August 2020 was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using relevant keywords to detect eligible articles. A random-effects model was used to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence (95% CI). Nine eligible trials were included in the final analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that serum ALT concentrations were significantly reduced using saffron compared to placebo (WMD: -2.39 U/L; 95% CI: -4.57 to -0.22; <i>P</i> = 0.03, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>= 87.9%, <i>P</i> < 0.001).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21291560/,Does prenatal micronutrient supplementation improve children's mental development? A systematic review,21291560,2011-02-03,"BACKGROUND:
Although maternal nutrient status influences all aspects of fetal development including the brain, the impact of micronutrient supplementation on the baby's mental function is a topic of debate. This systematic review assesses the effect of single and multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on offspring mental development.

METHODS:
Eleven electronic literature databases were searched using key terms of various combinations and filter string terms. Reference lists of articles selected for review were scanned for citations fitting the same inclusion criteria. Each stage of the literature retrieval and review process was conducted independently by two reviewers. The CONSORT checklist was used to assess study quality.

RESULTS:
A total of 1316 articles were retrieved from the electronic database search, of which 18 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The selected studies were randomized controlled trials published from 1983 to 2010, with high variance in sample size, intervention type, and outcome measures. The median CONSORT score was 15 (range 12 - 19). Due to inconsistent interventions and outcome measures among the studies, no conclusive evidence was found that enhancing the intrauterine environment through micronutrient supplementation was associated with child mental development in a number of dimensions. There was some evidence to support n-3 fatty acids or multi-micronutrients having some positive effect on mental development, but the evidence for single nutrients was much weaker.

CONCLUSIONS:
The study of children's mental outcomes as a function of prenatal supplementation is still relatively new, but the results of this systematic review suggest that further work with multiple micronutrients and/or n-3 fatty acids should be conducted.",Does prenatal micronutrient supplementation improve children's mental development?,"The study of children's mental outcomes as a function of prenatal supplementation is still relatively new, but the results of this systematic review suggest that further work with multiple micronutrients and/or n-3 fatty acids should be conducted."

Despite the global importance of this cancer, until recently little was known about risk factors apart from the well-established factors: age, family history and country of birth. The large worldwide variation in prostate cancer risk and increased risk in migrants moving from low to high risk countries provides strong support for modifiable environmental factors. We have based our review on the findings of a systematic review undertaken by an expert panel on behalf of the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research, and new data since then, linking identified foods and nutrients with prostate cancer. Evidence indicates that foods containing lycopene, as well as selenium and foods containing it, probably protect against prostate cancer, and excess consumption of foods or supplements containing calcium are a probable cause of this cancer. The expert panel also concluded that it is unlikely that beta-carotene (whether from foods or supplements) has a substantial effect on the risk of this cancer. A recent review on environmental factors in human prostate cancer also found that there were protective effects of vitamin E, pulses, soy foods and high plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. The Mediterranean diet is abundant in foods that may protect against prostate cancer and is associated with longevity and reduced cardiovascular and cancer mortality. Compared with many Western countries Greece has lower prostate cancer mortality and Greek migrant men in Australia have retained their low risk for prostate cancer.

A systematic review,28939430,2017-09-20,"The human body associates sensory cues with metabolic consequences. Exposure to sweet-tasting sugars - even in the absence of ingestion - triggers physiological responses that are associated with carbohydrate digestion, absorption and metabolism. These responses include the release of insulin and incretin hormones, which work to reduce blood glucose. For this reason, non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) have been posited to trigger similar physiological responses and reduce postprandial blood glucose concentrations. The first part of this review presents a brief overview of sweet taste receptor activation in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract and the ensuing physiological responses related to glucose homeostasis. The second part of this review contains a systematic literature review that tested the hypothesis that NNS use improves glucose regulation postprandially. Studies were grouped based on sweet taste receptor stimulation paradigms, including pre-ingestive stimulation, ingestion of NNS alone, co-ingestion of NNS with foods, and using NNS as preloads to influence subsequent blood glucose excursions.

To review systematically the evidence on breakfast cereal consumption and obesity in children and adolescents and assess whether the regular consumption of breakfast cereals could help to prevent excessive weight gain.

METHODS:
A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies relating breakfast cereal consumption to BMI, BMI z-scores and prevalence of obesity as the outcomes.

RESULTS:
14 papers met the inclusion criteria. The computed effect size for mean BMI between high consumers and low or non-consumers over all 25 study subgroups was -1.13 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.81, -1.46, p < 0.0001) in the random effects model, which is equivalent to a standardised mean difference of 0.24. Adjustment for age and publication bias attenuated the effect sizes somewhat but they remained statistically significant. The prevalence and risk of overweight was lower in children and adolescents who consume breakfast cereals regularly compared to those who consume them infrequently. Energy intakes tended to be higher in regular breakfast cereal consumers.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, the evidence reviewed is suggestive that regular consumption of breakfast cereals results in a lower BMI and a reduced likelihood of being overweight in children and adolescents. However, more evidence from long-term trials and investigations into mechanisms is needed to eliminate possible confounding factors and determine causality.",Does regular breakfast cereal consumption help children and adolescents stay slimmer?,"Overall, the evidence reviewed is suggestive that regular consumption of breakfast cereals results in a lower BMI and a reduced likelihood of being overweight in children and adolescents.

Cognitive impairment is a staggering personal and societal burden; accordingly, there is a strong interest in potential strategies for its prevention and treatment. Nutritional supplements have been extensively investigated, and citicoline seems to be a promising agent; its role in clinical practice, however, has not been established. We systematically reviewed studies on the effect of citicoline on cognitive performance.

METHODS:
We searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for articles published between 2010 and 2022. Relevant information was extracted and presented following the PRISMA recommendations. Data were pooled using the inverse-variance method with random effects models.

RESULTS:
We selected seven studies including patients with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease or post-stroke dementia. All the studies showed a positive effect of citicoline on cognitive functions. Six studies could be included in the meta-analysis. Overall, citicoline improved cognitive status, with pooled standardized mean differences ranging from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37-0.75) to 1.57 (95% CI: 0.77-2.37) in different sensitivity analyses.

A systematic literature review,23185146,2012-11-23,"It is increasingly acknowledged that the maternal diet influences fetal development and health of the child. Milk and milk products contribute essential nutrients and bioactive substances; they are of ample supply and have a long tradition in Nordic countries. To revise and update dietary guidelines for pregnant women valid in Nordic countries, the Pregnancy and Lactation expert group within the NNR5 project identified a need to systematically review recent scientific data on infant growth measures and maternal milk consumption. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of milk and dairy consumption during pregnancy on fetal growth through a systematic review of studies published between January 2000 and December 2011. A literature search was run in June 2011. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion from the 495 abstracts according to predefined eligibility criteria. A complementary search in January 2012 revealed 64 additional abstracts published during the period June to December 2011, among them one study of interest previously identified. Of the 33 studies extracted, eight were relevant research papers. Five were prospective cohort studies (including a retrospective chart review), one was a case-control study, and two were retrospective cohort studies. For fetal length or infant birth length, three studies reported no association and two reported positive associations with milk or dairy consumption. For birthweight related outcomes, two studies reported no associations, and four studies reported positive associations with milk and/or dairy consumption.

We used random-effects models with DerSimonian-Laird methods to analyze the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase enzymes. Our results indicate that curcumin did not affect serum alanine aminotransferase, but it did reduce aspartate aminotransferase levels. Notably, both outcomes showed high heterogeneity (p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed that adding piperine to curcumin did not benefit aminotransferase levels in NAFLD patients. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between the duration of the intervention and the relative (mg/kg/day) curcumin dose with the reduction in liver aminotransferases.

Key findings include significantly lower serum magnesium levels in CD patients (0.79 ± 0.09 mmol/L) compared to controls (0.82 ± 0.06 mmol/L), with up to 50% prevalence of hypomagnesemia in CD patients observed in one study. Notably, CD patients, particularly men, exhibited lower magnesium intake (men: 276.4 mg/day; women: 198.2 mg/day). Additionally, low magnesium levels correlated with increased sleep latency (95% CI -0.65 to -0.102; <i>p</i> = 0.011) and decreased sleep duration (95% CI -0.613 to -0.041; <i>p</i> = 0.028). Another key finding was the significant association between low serum magnesium levels and elevated CRP levels as an indicator of CD disease activity. The findings support the hypothesis that serum magnesium levels are significantly lower in CD patients compared to healthy controls and suggest that magnesium supplementation could improve CD management by enhancing remission rates and sleep quality. However, more rigorous, evidence-based research is necessary to define specific supplementation protocols and to fully elucidate the role of magnesium in CD pathophysiology.",Does magnesium provide a protective effect in Crohn's Disease remission?,"The findings support the hypothesis that serum magnesium levels are significantly lower in CD patients compared to healthy controls and suggest that magnesium supplementation could improve CD management by enhancing remission rates and sleep quality.

They are a rich source of sulfur compounds, such as glucosinolates (GLSs) and isothiocyanates (ITCs), which provide health benefits but are also suspected of having a goitrogenic effect. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of dietary interventions on thyroid function, in terms of the potential risk for people with thyroid dysfunctions. We analyzed the results of 123 articles of in vitro, animal, and human studies, describing the impact of brassica plants and extracts on thyroid mass and histology, blood levels of TSH, T3, T4, iodine uptake, and the effect on thyroid cancer cells. We also presented the mechanisms of the goitrogenic potential of GLSs and ITCs, the limitations of the studies included, as well as further research directions. The vast majority of the results cast doubt on previous assumptions claiming that brassica plants have antithyroid effects in humans. Instead, they indicate that including brassica vegetables in the daily diet, particularly when accompanied by adequate iodine intake, poses no adverse effects on thyroid function.",Do brassica vegetables affect thyroid function?,"The vast majority of the results cast doubt on previous assumptions claiming that brassica plants have antithyroid effects in humans.

A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials,37447398,2023-07-07,"Vitamin D has been shown to have multiple pleiotropic effects beyond bone and mineral metabolism, with purported roles in cardiovascular disease, cancer, and host immunity. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, current clinical practice has favored the use of the active hormone. Whether vitamin D deficiency should be corrected in patients with ESKD remains unclear, as few randomized trials have been conducted. In this systematic review, we summarize the current evidence examining whether vitamin D supplementation improves outcomes, beyond mineral metabolism, in patients with ESKD. Data from randomized controlled trials of adults with ESKD were obtained by searching Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Web of Science Core Collection from inception to February 2023. Twenty-three trials composed of 2489 participants were identified for inclusion. Data were synthesized by two independent reviewers and summarized in tables organized by outcome. Outcomes included measures of mortality, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, muscle strength/function, nutrition, patient well-being, and outcomes specific to ESKD including erythropoietin usage, pruritus, and dialysis access maturation. The Cochrane risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2, 2019) was used to assess study quality. Overall, our findings indicate a minimal and varied benefit of native vitamin D supplementation. From the largest studies included, we determine that vitamin D has no demonstrated effect on patient-reported measures of well-being or utilization of erythropoietin, nor does it change levels of the inflammation biomarker <i>C</i>-reactive protein. Included trials were heterogeneous with regards to outcomes, and the majority studied small participant populations with a relatively short follow-up. We conclude that vitamin D supplementation corrects vitamin D deficiency and is safe and well-tolerated in humans with ESKD.

Oxidative stress is related to many chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancers, hypertension, and heart diseases. Antioxidant activity of pomegranate due to high content of polyphenols, flavonoids, and several other types of antioxidant compounds has been of interest; however, the findings on its antioxidant effects are inconsistent.

OBJECTIVE:
To assess the effects of pomegranate consumption on multiple oxidative stress biomarkers using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs).

METHODS:
A comprehensive electronic search on PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted up to May 2021. The risk of bias assessment was evaluated by Cochrane Collaboration's tool and a random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size of the included studies.

RESULTS:
Our search identified 1692 studies, of which 21 were entered in the final analysis. The results showed that the consumption of pomegranate compared with the control group was associated with a significant elevation in the levels of TAC [SMD = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42, 1.02, P < 0.001] and SOD [SMD = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.25, 1.19, P = 0.002] and reduction in the levels of MDA [SMD = -0.98, 95% CI: -1.49, -0.46, P < 0.001].

Recent original research and meta-analyses suggest that acute caffeine supplementation improves exercise performance in team-sport athletes (TSA). Nonetheless, most of the studies testing the effects of caffeine on TSA included samples of male athletes, and there is no meta-analysis of the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine on female TSA. The aim of the present study was to synthesize the existing literature regarding the effect of caffeine supplementation on physical performance in adult female TSA.

METHODS:
A search was performed in Pubmed/Medline, SPORTDiscus and Scopus. The search was performed from the inception of indexing until 1 September 2021. Crossover randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effects of oral caffeine intake on several aspects of performance in female TSA were selected. The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed for individual studies using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (PEDro) and the RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) was performed for several performance variables.

RESULTS:
The search retrieved 18 articles that fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Overall, most of the studies were of excellent quality with a low risk of bias. The meta-analysis results showed that caffeine increased performance in specific team-sport skills (SMD: 0.384, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.077-0.691), countermovement jump (SMD: 0.208, CI: 0.079-0.337), total body impacts (SMD: 0.488; 95% CI: 0.050, 0.927) and handgrip strength (SMD: 0.395, CI: 0.126-0.665). No effects were found on the ratings of perceived exertion, squat jumps, agility, repeated sprint ability or agility tests performed after fatigue.

CONCLUSIONS:

The results from 19 studies showed that the consumption of millets for periods as short as 21 days to 4 months reduced levels of TC, triacylglycerol, LDL-C, and VLDL-C (<i>p</i><0.01) by 8.0, 9.5, 10 and 9.0%, respectively. Four studies demonstrated that millets consumption brought TC and triacylglycerol levels to the normal levels (<200 and <150 mg/dl, respectively). Furthermore, upon consumption of millet-based meals, there was a 6.0% increase in the HDL-C 4.0 and 5.0% reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 7.0% reduction in body mass index (BMI).

To test the hypothesis that high daily sodium intake induces systemic inflammatory response in humans, we performed a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of high versus low sodium dose (HSD vs. LSD), as defined per study, on plasma circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Eight RCTs that examined CRP, TNF-a and IL-6 were found. Meta-analysis testing the change of each biomarker in HSD versus LSD was possible for CRP (<i>n</i> = 5 studies), TNF-a (<i>n</i> = 4 studies) and IL-6 (<i>n</i> = 4 studies). The pooled difference (95% confidence intervals) per biomarker was for: CRP values of 0.1(-0.3, 0.4) mg/L; TNF-a -0.7(-5.0, 3.6) pg/mL; IL-6 -1.1(-3.3 to 1.1) pg/mL.

Cognitive function, including executive function (EF)-related capacities (eg, working memory, inhibitory and attentional control), has been linked to adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors. Dehydration is associated with impaired cognitive function, whereas improvements in hydration status may improve inhibitory and attentional performance. No systematic reviews have examined the effects of both dehydration and euhydration on EF.

OBJECTIVE:
The objectives of this systematic review are to examine studies that have investigated the spectrum of hydration status and EF in adults, and to identify future research needs.

DESIGN:
The review was conducted according to the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The database search was initially conducted on May 12, 2019 and then updated on April 26, 2020. Databases searched included PubMed, Medline, Psyc Info, SCOPUS, Proquest, and ISI Web of Science. Data extraction included the following: method used to assess de/hydration status, study design, participant characteristics, EF tasks and domain, and results. Article quality ratings were performed on included studies using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Rating Checklist.

PARTICIPANTS/SETTING:
Studies done with healthy or diseased adults, aged older than 18 years, in any setting, were included. Studies of individuals with disease states that impact fluid balance or require fluid restrictions as treatments were excluded.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
All EF-related outcomes were included, such as working memory, inhibitory control, task switching, and attention.

RESULTS:
Four thousand eight hundred thirty-three articles were screened using title/abstracts. Seventy-one full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 33 were included (26 included investigations of dehydration; 27 included investigations of rehydration/euhydration) with 3,636 participants across all studies. Little consistency was found across outcomes. Roughly half of the available studies suggested unclear or neutral EF effects, and half suggested effects on EF domains, particularly working memory, inhibitory control, and attention. Studies including a euhydration condition were slightly more likely to demonstrate improvements to EF capacities.

Pomegranate was used in some studies as capsules (between 250 mg and 250 g) and some in liquid form (between 10 and 500 ml), and the follow-up duration varied from 3 weeks to 12 months. Standardized mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the effect size of pomegranate supplementation on oxidative stress biomarkers. Based on the results, pomegranate decreased but it was not statistically significant and the same result was obtained for ox-LDL and POX 1. In addition, the results showed that pomegranate consumption can significantly increase GPX and TAC. Result of combination of on TBRAS showed significantly effect of pomegranate use on reduction of TBRAS. Since this study has evaluated mostly Eastern countries' studies it could be concluded that pomegranate supplements are effective in modifying oxidative stress in Eastern countries. The evidence to support this study is low, therefore, needs the future studies to confirm the results.","Is consumption of pomegranate supplementation effective on oxidative stress biomarkers including MDA, ox-LDL, POX 1, GPX, TAC, and TBRAS?","Since these findings have evaluated mostly Eastern countries' studies it could be concluded that pomegranate supplements are effective in modifying oxidative stress in Eastern countries.

A systematic review,36648071,2023-01-17,"Objective: To summarise the associations between antenatal or early-life blood vitamin D and the development of eczema/food allergy in childhood.

Design: A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to synthesize the published literature. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection and data extraction on Covidence. We assessed the risk of bias for observational studies by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for clinical trials. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).

Data sources: We systematically searched PubMed and Embase from inception and April 2022.

Eligibility criteria: Human studies that investigated prospective associations between antenatal or early-life blood vitamin D levels, dietary intake or supplementation and childhood eczema/food allergy.

Results: Forty-three articles including six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Four RCTs of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy showed no evidence of an effect on the incidence of eczema (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 0.85; 0.67-1.08, I2 = 6.7%, n = 2074). Three RCTs reported null associations between supplementation in pregnancy/infancy and food allergy. From six cohort studies, increasing cord blood vitamin D levels were associated with reduced prevalence of eczema at/close to age one (OR per 10 nmol/L increase = 0.89; 0.84-0.94, I2 = 0%, 2025 participants). We found no evidence of an association between maternal antenatal or infant vitamin D level or dietary intake and the development of food allergy or eczema in offspring.

Conclusions: We found an association between higher vitamin D levels in cord blood and reduced risk of eczema in cohort studies. Further trials with maternal and infant supplementation are needed to confirm if vitamin D supplementation can effectively prevent eczema or food allergy in childhood.",Is antenatal or early-life vitamin D associated with eczema or food allergy in childhood?,We found an association between higher vitamin D levels in cord blood and reduced risk of eczema in cohort studies.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35842938/,What is the impact of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) plus calcium on the incidence of hip fracture in older people? A systematic review and meta-analysis,35842938,2022-07-17,"Introduction: Hip fractures have a huge impact in reducing the quality of life and increasing mortality. This review aims to assess the impact of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 plus calcium on the incidence of hip fracture in people over 65 years.

Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed and RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 plus calcium in preventing hip fracture in adults over 65 years were included in the study. The databases such as Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus were searched from October 2019- January 2020.The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to check the quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis with fixed effect model using Review Manager (Revman 5.3) was used to analyse the data.

Results: The meta-analysis of seven RCTs on vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation and hip fracture (n = 12,620) identified odds ratio (OR) of 0.75; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.64, 0.87; p = .0003. Daily oral supplementation of 800 IU of Vitamin D3 plus 1200 mg of calcium was found more effective (n = 5676 participants; OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; p < .0001) than daily oral supplementation of 800 IU of Vitamin D3 plus 1000 mg of calcium (n = 6555,OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.56; p = .70) in reducing hip fracture. A meta-analysis of the seven RCTs to identify the incidence of non-vertebral fracture gave the OR of 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89; p < .0001. A meta-analysis of three RCTs on femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) (n = 483) gave a mean difference of 1.21; 95% CI: -0.79, 3.20; p = .24.

Conclusion: Daily oral supplementation 800 IU of vitamin D3 plus 1200 mg of calcium reduces hip fracture and non-vertebral fracture in older people. Administering vitamin D3 and calcium supplements had no effect in increasing the femoral neck BMD.

Implications for practice: Even though it is evident from the review that optimal daily intake of vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation help in the prevention of fracture, it is only one essential element in fracture prevention. Also, people who are on dietary supplements should be compliant with same for better result. Efforts to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis should begin from an early age. It includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle, optimal intake of calcium and vitamin D3, proper nutrition, adequate exposure to sunlight, exercise etc. Proper education on healthy lifestyle, avoiding risk factors like smoking, caffeine, alcohol and awareness of bone health should continue throughout life with emphasis during menopause when increased bone loss is expected.",What is the impact of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) plus calcium on the incidence of hip fracture in older people?,"Daily oral supplementation 800 IU of vitamin D3 plus 1200 mg of calcium reduces hip fracture and non-vertebral fracture in older people.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35400251/,Can omega-3 fatty acids be beneficial in pediatric NAFLD? A systematic review and meta-analysis,35400251,2022-04-11,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease in children and no medications or supplements are currently recommended. The role of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids has been investigated in clinical trials with promising results. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed summary of the evidence about the efficacy of n-3 in the treatment of pediatric NAFLD. A systematic literature search was performed through major electronic databases up to September 20, 2021 for randomized placebo-controlled trials, investigating the efficacy of n-3 fatty acids in children with NAFLD. The primary outcomes were changes in serum transaminases concentration, Body Mass Index (BMI) and improvement of ultrasonographic liver steatosis. The secondary outcomes were changes in the patients' serum lipid profile, γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (ΗΟΜΑ-ΙR) and waist circumference (WC). Results were expressed as mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Six RCTs (n = 378 patients) were included. Treatment with n-3, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in transaminases concentration. In addition, a significant improvement in liver steatosis assessed by ultrasonography and a decrease in BMI were observed. N-3 fatty acids supplementation seems to be an effective alternative treatment in pediatric NAFLD by improving liver biochemistry, ultrasonographic steatosis and BMI. Further research is required concerning the effect of n-3 fatty acids in liver histology.",Can omega-3 fatty acids be beneficial in pediatric NAFLD?,"Treatment with omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in transaminases concentration.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35166850/,Does vitamin D supplementation reduce COVID-19 severity?: a systematic review,35166850,2022-10-25,"Background: The evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing severity of COVID-19 is still insufficient. This is partially due to the lack of primary robust trial-based data and heterogeneous study designs.

Aim: This evidence summary, aims to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on morbidity and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.Design: Evidence summary of systematic reviews.

Methods: For this study, systematic reviews and meta-analysis published from December 2019 to January 2022 presenting the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 severity were screened and selected from PubMed and Google scholar. After initial screening, 10 eligible reviews were identified and quality of included reviews were assessed using AMSTAR and GRADE tools and overlapping among the primary studies used were also assessed.

Results: The number of primary studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 3 to 13. Meta-analysis of seven systematic reviews showed strong evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of mortality (Odds ratio: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.346-0.664; P < 0.001) in COVID patients. It was also observed that supplementation reduces the need for intensive care (Odds ratio: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.28-0.44; P < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (Odds ratio: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.411-0.708; P < 0.001) requirement. The findings were robust and reliable as level of heterogeneity was considerably low. However the included studies were of varied quality. Qualitative analysis showed that supplements (oral and IV) are well tolerated, safe and effective in COVID patients.

Conclusion: The findings of this study show that vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing the COVID-19 severity. Hence, vitamin D should be recommended as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19.However, more robust and larger trials are required to substantiate it further.",Does vitamin D supplementation reduce COVID-19 severity?,"The findings show that vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing the COVID-19 severity.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35389470/,"Does the evidence support a relationship between higher levels of nut consumption, lower risk of depression, and better mood state in the general population? A systematic review",35389470,2022-09-05,"Context: Dietary patterns play a key role in mental health, depression, and mood state. However, the evidence concerning specific foods highly recommended for mental health, such as nuts, has not yet been synthesized.

Objective: The objective of this review was to synthesize the evidence for a relationship between higher levels of nut consumption, lower risk of depression, and better mood state in the general population.

Data sources: The MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases were systematically searched from each database's inception to March 2021.

Data extraction: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies exploring the association between nut consumption, level of depression, and mood state in the general population were included. The quality of the studies was measured through the Joanna Briggs Institute tool (cross-sectional studies), the NIH Quality Assessment Tool (cohort studies), and the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (RCTs). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed.

Data analysis: A total of 10 studies involving 66 418 individuals were included, of which 3 were cross-sectional, 3 were cohort studies, and 4 were RCTs. In studies concerned with depression (n = 6 studies), a higher level of nut consumption was associated with a lower risk of depression in 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 cohort study, while a similar but nonsignificant association was found in another cohort and in two RCTs. In studies concerned with mood state (n = 4), 1 cohort study reported an association between higher nut consumption and significant improvement in mood state, whereas (nonsignificant) associations between higher nut consumption and increased negative feelings were reported in a cross-sectional study and two RCTs.

Conclusion: Despite the small number of studies and the limitations related to them, such as reverse causation bias, overall, the available literature suggests that higher nut consumption could be associated with a lower risk of depression, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mood state in the general population.","Does the evidence support a relationship between higher levels of nut consumption, lower risk of depression, and better mood state in the general population?","Despite the small number of studies and the limitations related to them, such as reverse causation bias, overall, the available literature suggests that higher nut consumption could be associated with a lower risk of depression, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mood state in the general population."

A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis of Clinical Trials,28288837,2017-03-10,"Purpose: We sought to clarify the association between cranberry intake and the prevention of urinary tract infections.

Materials and methods: This systematic review, which complies with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, was done as a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials.

Results: The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection. Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infections as indicated by the weighted risk ratio (0.6750, 95% CI 0.5516-0.7965, p <0.0001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at some risk for urinary tract infections were more susceptible to the effects of cranberry ingestion.

Conclusions: The results of the current study could be used by physicians to recommend cranberry ingestion to decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections, particularly in individuals with recurrent urinary tract infections. This would also reduce the administration of antibiotics, which could be beneficial since antibiotics can lead to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms.",Can cranberries contribute to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections?,"The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection.

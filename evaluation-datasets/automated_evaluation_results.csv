Do low-carbon-emission diets lead to higher nutritional quality and positive health outcomes?,Dietary scenarios that have lower greenhouse gas emissions compared with average consumption patterns may not result in improvements in nutritional quality or health outcomes. Dietary recommendations for reduced greenhouse gas emissions must also address sugar consumption and micronutrient intake.,"In conclusion, adopting a low-carbon-emission diet can lead to higher nutritional quality and positive health outcomes if it is well-planned and includes a variety of plant-based foods while ensuring adequate intake of all essential nutrients.",0.264541626,0.4389564097
Is binge eating associated with poor weight loss outcomes in people with a high body weight?,"Our findings showed no difference in weight loss in people with or without pre-treatment binge eating who received various weight loss treatments. Weight loss treatments should not be withheld on the basis that they will not be effective in people with pre-treatment binge eating, albeit their safety and longer term impacts are unclear.","Overall, the evidence strongly indicates that binge eating is associated with poor weight loss outcomes in individuals with high body weight. Addressing binge eating behaviors through a combination of psychological, behavioral, and, where appropriate, pharmacological interventions is crucial for improving weight loss outcomes in this population.",0.3093059659,0.4605668187
Are anti-inflammatory foods associated with a protective effect for cutaneous melanoma?,"Food components considered as anti-inflammatory, such as vitamin D, vitamin A, folic acid, niacin, vitamin C, omega-3 fatty acids, and carotenoids (β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene), were not associated with a protective effect for melanoma. Other anti-inflammatory food items, such as tea, fruits, and vegetables, except for citrus fruits that were borderline associated with an increased risk, were not associated with cutaneous melanoma. In conclusion, the only anti-inflammatory food item that was consistently associated with a protective effect for cutaneous was coffee in particular caffeinated coffee.","While these findings are promising, they are primarily based on observational studies, reviews of existing literature, and a limited number of clinical trials. The mechanisms by which these foods and compounds exert their effects are complex and not fully understood. Additionally, the studies vary in their methodologies, populations studied, and the types of anti-inflammatory compounds examined.",-0.05000561476,0.4619983435
"Does taking vitamin, mineral and fatty acid supplements prevent cognitive decline?",There was little evidence of a beneficial effect from taking B vitamins or antioxidant supplements on global cognitive function in later life. Larger-scale randomized controlled trials of longer duration in selected age groups are needed.,"The benefits of Vitamin B are potentially lowering homocysteine levels, which might reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The benefits of polyunsaturated fatty acids are that they can enhance cognitive functions and may counteract the negative effects of poor dietary habits. The benefits of combination therapies are potential synergistic benefits in cognitive function from combinations like estrogen, statins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. While the benefits are promising, the studies often call for more research to fully understand the effectiveness and safety of long-term supplementation. Dosage and the specific combinations of supplements need to be carefully considered to avoid potential adverse effects. Individuals, particularly those at risk of cognitive decline or with existing mild cognitive impairment, might consider discussing with healthcare providers the possibility of incorporating certain supplements into their regimen. However, it is crucial to do so under professional guidance to tailor the supplement type and dosage to individual health needs and conditions.",0.09011174738,0.4866028428
Does sodium intake induce systemic inflammatory response?,"Although our results suggest that the different levels of daily sodium intake are not associated with significant changes in the level of systemic inflammation in humans, this outcome may result from methodological issues.","In conclusion, while sodium is essential for various bodily functions, excessive intake can lead to systemic inflammation, contributing to the development and exacerbation of hypertension, cardiovascular, and renal diseases. It is crucial to manage sodium intake to mitigate these health risks.",0.2190889716,0.501537323
Should we recommend low-fat diets for obesity?,"There were no significant differences between low-fat diets and other weight-reducing diets in terms of sustained weight loss. In overweight or obese individuals who are dieting for the purpose of weight reduction, low-fat diets are as efficacious as other weight-reducing diets for achieving sustained weight loss, but not more so.","Low-fat diets can be recommended for managing obesity, particularly when combined with a comprehensive lifestyle approach that includes dietary counseling, physical activity, and behavioral modifications. However, individual adherence varies, and dietary recommendations should be personalized to increase the likelihood of long-term success. Healthcare providers should monitor lipid profiles and overall health status to adjust dietary plans as necessary to ensure nutritional adequacy and address any potential negative effects on lipid levels.",0.09667455405,0.5115911365
Does curcumin improve liver enzymes levels in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?,"Results indicate that curcumin did not affect serum alanine aminotransferase, but it did reduce aspartate aminotransferase levels. Notably, both outcomes showed high heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis revealed that adding piperine to curcumin did not benefit aminotransferase levels in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between the duration of the intervention and the relative (mg/kg/day) curcumin dose with the reduction in liver aminotransferases. In summary, the sources of heterogeneity identified in our study are likely attributed to the duration of the intervention and the relative dose of curcumin. Consequently, longer trials utilizing high doses of curcumin could diminish the positive impact of curcumin in reducing serum levels of aminotransferases in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","The evidence supports the use of curcumin as an adjunct therapy for improving liver enzyme levels and overall liver health in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, further high-quality, large-scale studies are needed to fully establish the clinical benefits and optimal dosing strategies.",0.1925661564,0.5359122753
Does saffron supplementation have favorable effects on liver function indicators?,"We did not find a significant dose-response relationship between dosage and duration of saffron supplementation on serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. We found that saffron supplementation can reduce alanine aminotransferase serum concentrations without significant effects on other liver function indicators, including aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Nevertheless, future large randomized controlled trials on diverse populations are needed to understand better the effects of saffron and its constituents on these enzymes.","These findings collectively suggest that saffron and its active components, crocin and crocetin, can beneficially modulate liver function indicators, particularly in conditions associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. However, it is essential to consider that most of the current evidence is derived from animal studies and controlled experimental settings. Further clinical research in humans is necessary to confirm these effects and establish appropriate dosages and long-term safety.",0.09178114682,0.5382189751
Does native vitamin D supplementation have pleiotropic effects in patients with end-stage kidney disease?,"Overall, our findings indicate a minimal and varied benefit of native vitamin D supplementation. From the largest studies included, we determine that vitamin D has no demonstrated effect on patient-reported measures of well-being or utilization of erythropoietin, nor does it change levels of the inflammation biomarker C-reactive protein. Included trials were heterogeneous with regards to outcomes, and the majority studied small participant populations with a relatively short follow-up. We conclude that vitamin D supplementation corrects vitamin D deficiency and is safe and well-tolerated in humans with end-stage kidney disease. However, it is not clear from clinical trials conducted to date that a causal pathway exists between 25(OH)D and pleiotropic effects that is responsive to vitamin D treatment.","In conclusion, native vitamin D supplementation can have multiple beneficial pleiotropic effects in patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly regarding cardiovascular health, inflammation, immune function, and bone health. However, these benefits must be balanced with careful monitoring to avoid potential risks associated with vitamin D therapy.",0.207694903,0.5410217047
Can avocado intake improve weight loss in adults with excess weight?,"No significant changes in body weight, body mass index, percent of body fat, or visceral adipose tissue in response to intervention was seen in the avocado group compared with the control group. Also, the pooled results showed no reduction in body weight and composition of avocado in comparison to control. Secondary outcomes showed some potential benefits in metabolic parameters, mainly related to lipid profile. Consumption of avocado did not promote weight gain, and further studies are needed to elucidate this effect.","Avocado intake can enhance satiety, reduce energy intake, support weight loss in energy-restricted diets, and improve metabolic health markers such as serum triglycerides and gut microbiota. There are no significant risks associated with avocado consumption in the context of weight management, except potential calorie addition if not balanced within the diet. Including avocados in a balanced, energy-restricted diet could be a beneficial strategy for weight loss and overall metabolic health in adults with excess weight.",0.1070303246,0.5689245462
Does infant formula containing synbiotics support adequate growth in infants?,The main results indicate a non-significant increase in infant's growth following synbiotics supplementation of infant formula. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm present findings.,"In summary, synbiotic-supplemented infant formulas support adequate growth in infants and may offer additional health benefits such as improved gastrointestinal health, enhanced immune function, and better quality of life. These formulas appear to be a viable option for infant feeding, including for those with specific needs such as allergies to cow's milk.",0.2587529421,0.5696384311
What is the influence of cinnamon supplementation on liver enzymes?,"The pooled analysis indicated that cinnamon supplementation had no significant effect on serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. However, there was a significant reduction in alanine aminotransferase levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and in trials with low-dose supplementation (<1,500 mg/d), follow-up duration longer than 12 weeks, and in the elderly patients (aged>50 years). The beneficial effects of cinnamon intake were also shown in aspartate aminotransferase levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and trials with long-term follow-up (>12 weeks). Longer-term, oral cinnamon supplementation may improve serum levels of liver enzymes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further high-quality studies are needed, especially in populations with abnormal liver enzyme levels, to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of cinnamon on liver function.","In conclusion, cinnamon supplementation may have beneficial effects on liver enzymes, particularly at specific dosages and over longer durations. However, the overall evidence is mixed, and there may be potential risks and interactions associated with its chronic use. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of cinnamon on liver enzymes and to establish standardized guidelines for its safe and effective use.",0.09830898792,0.572914362
Are Atkins and other low-carbohydrate diets a hoax or an effective tool for weight loss?,"The apparent paradox that ad-libitum intake of high-fat foods produces weight loss might be due to severe restriction of carbohydrate depleting glycogen stores, leading to excretion of bound water, the ketogenic nature of the diet being appetite suppressing, the high protein-content being highly satiating and reducing spontaneous food intake, or limited food choices leading to decreased energy intake. Long-term studies are needed to measure changes in nutritional status and body composition during the low-carbohydrate diet, and to assess fasting and postprandial cardiovascular risk factors and adverse effects. Without that information, low-carbohydrate diets cannot be recommended.","In conclusion, low-carbohydrate diets like the Atkins diet are not a hoax and can be effective for weight loss and improving certain metabolic health markers. However, individuals considering these diets should be aware of the potential challenges related to long-term adherence and the need for further research into their long-term safety and efficacy. As with any diet, it is advisable to consult healthcare professionals before making significant changes to dietary habits.",0.1335987002,0.5825534463
Is there a dose-response relation of dietary glycemic load to risk of type 2 diabetes?,"After we accounted for several sources of heterogeneity, findings from prospective cohort studies that related the glycemic load to type 2 diabetes appear robust and consistently indicate strong and significantly lower type 2 diabetes risk in persons who consume lower-glycemic load diets.","In summary, there is a dose-response relationship between dietary glycemic load and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with higher glycemic load associated with increased risk and lower glycemic load potentially offering protective benefits. This relationship is influenced by the type of carbohydrates consumed, individual metabolic responses, and adherence to dietary recommendations over time.",0.292994827,0.5838332176
Does hydration status influence executive function?,"Little consistency was found across outcomes. Roughly half of the available studies suggested unclear or neutral executive function effects, and half suggested effects on executive function domains, particularly working memory, inhibitory control, and attention. Studies including a euhydration condition were slightly more likely to demonstrate improvements to executive function capacities. Overall, there is a strong need for consistent methodological approaches and a greater number of long-term (ie, >3 days) studies of dehydration and euhydration and executive function.","These studies collectively indicate that maintaining hydration is crucial for sustaining or enhancing executive function, particularly in scenarios that demand high cognitive engagement and under stressful conditions such as heat. The benefits of adequate hydration include improved attention, better mood regulation, and enhanced overall cognitive performance, which are crucial for effective executive functioning.",0.1353729814,0.5902849436
"Does an increased intake of added sugar affect appetite in overweight or obese adults, when compared with lower intakes?","This review did not find a consistent relationship between added sugar intake and appetite measures, which may be partially explained by variations in study methodologies. There is a need for randomised controlled trials examining a range of added sugar sources and doses on appetite in overweight and obese adults to better understand implications for weight gain","In conclusion, increased intake of added sugars can potentially lead to an increase in appetite and greater caloric intake in overweight or obese adults, primarily due to physiological and hormonal mechanisms that influence satiety and hunger cues.",0.2452854663,0.6010507941
Does cooking with vegetable oils increase the risk of chronic diseases?,"We conclude that (1) the myth that frying foods is generally associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease is not supported by the available evidence; (2) virgin olive oil significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease clinical events, based on the results of a large randomised trial that included as part of the intervention the recommendation to use high amounts of virgin olive oil, also for frying foods; and (3) high consumption of fried foods is probably related to a higher risk of weight gain, though the type of oil may perhaps modify this association.","Cooking with vegetable oils, particularly when oils are repeatedly heated or partially hydrogenated, can increase the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. It is advisable to use fresh oil for cooking and opt for oils that are stable at high temperatures to minimize health risks.",0.1016499028,0.6045994163
Does high-carbohydrate intake lead to increased risk of obesity?,"On the basis of the current study, it cannot be concluded that a high-carbohydrate diet or increased percentage of total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates increases the odds of obesity. A central limitation of the study was the non-standard classification of dietary intake across the studies, as well as confounders like total energy intake, activity levels, age and gender. Further studies are needed that specifically classify refined versus unrefined carbohydrate intake, as well as studies that investigate the relationship between high fat, high unrefined carbohydrate-sugar diets.","High intake of carbohydrates, particularly refined carbohydrates, is linked to an increased risk of obesity. This relationship is influenced by the poor satiety response and adverse metabolic effects induced by high glycemic load foods. Reducing the intake of refined carbohydrates and focusing on more complex carbohydrates along with dietary fiber might help mitigate this risk.",0.1274724007,0.6228430271
Is a vegetarian diet safe to follow during pregnancy?,Asian vegetarian mothers presented increased risks to deliver babies with low birth weight than those of omnivores. Large-scale prospective studies focusing on pre- and/or early gestational nutrition will help clarify the correlation between vegetarian diet and various pregnancy outcomes.,"In conclusion, following a vegetarian diet during pregnancy is safe if it is well-planned and supplemented correctly to meet the increased nutritional needs during this period. Regular consultations with healthcare providers and nutritionists are essential to avoid potential nutrient deficiencies and ensure a healthy pregnancy outcome.",0.09588064998,0.6290306449
Can lycopene impact the androgen axis in prostate cancer?,"All studies demonstrated either null or, more commonly, inhibitory effects of tomato or lycopene treatment on androgen-related outcomes. Strong mechanistic evidence was unable to be ascertained, but tomato and lycopene treatment appears to down-regulate androgen metabolism and signaling in prostate cancer.","These studies collectively suggest that lycopene has the potential to affect the androgen axis in prostate cancer by modulating androgen receptor signaling and influencing the behavior of prostate cancer cells. However, further clinical studies are needed to fully establish the efficacy of lycopene as a therapeutic agent in the management of prostate cancer and to determine the optimal dosages and administration routes.",0.337575525,0.6367307901
Can the Mediterranean diet prevent prostate cancer?,"The Mediterranean diet is abundant in foods that may protect against prostate cancer and is associated with longevity and reduced cardiovascular and cancer mortality. Compared with many Western countries Greece has lower prostate cancer mortality and Greek migrant men in Australia have retained their low risk for prostate cancer. Consumption of a traditional Mediterranean diet, rich in bioactive nutrients, may confer protection to Greek migrant men, and this dietary pattern offers a palatable alternative for prevention of this disease.","Overall, while there is compelling evidence supporting the potential protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against prostate cancer, more large-scale studies are needed to solidify these associations and fully understand the mechanisms involved.",0.197660163,0.6442862749
"Does cocoa/dark chocolate supplementation have favorable effect on body weight, body mass index and waist circumference?",Cocoa/dark chocolate supplementation does not reduce anthropometric measures significantly. However subgroup analysis regarding dose (≥ 30 g/day) and duration (between 4 to 8 weeks) revealed significant reduction of body weight and body mass index.,"Cocoa and dark, polyphenol-rich chocolates have potential health benefits related to weight management and metabolic health. Benefits are more pronounced when cocoa is part of a balanced, low-fat diet and consumed in moderation. The form of chocolate and its composition (cocoa content) play a crucial role in determining its health impact.",0.0865451619,0.6453903913
Is dairy consumption associated with depressive symptoms or disorders in adults?,"Findings were mixed, with one study reporting a positive association; five studies reporting no association; and seven studies reporting mixed associations depending on dairy type, gender or population group. We found conflicting and inconsistent associations in studies that were generally of fair quality. Future longitudinal and intervention studies that employ more rigorous dietary assessment methods are warranted.","There is some evidence suggesting that dairy consumption might be associated with lower depressive symptoms, particularly in specific populations such as those with multiple sclerosis or post-myocardial infarandomized controlled trialion. More comprehensive studies are required to establish a clear causal relationship between dairy consumption and depressive symptoms in the general adult population. Given the mixed evidence, individuals should consider maintaining a balanced diet and consult healthcare professionals for personalized dietary advice, especially if experiencing depressive symptoms.",0.05669873953,0.6459783316
Is a vegan or a vegetarian diet associated with the microbiota composition in the gut?,"No consistent association between a vegan diet or vegetarian diet and microbiota composition compared to omnivores could be identified. Moreover, some studies revealed contradictory results. This result could be due to high microbial individuality, and/or differences in the applied approaches. Standardized methods with high taxonomical and functional resolutions are needed to clarify this issue.","Vegan and vegetarian diets are associated with a gut microbiota composition that supports health benefits due to their high fiber content and plant-based nature. These diets promote the growth of beneficial microbial communities, which are crucial for metabolic health and reducing inflammation. It is essential to manage these diets well to avoid potential deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin B12, iron, and zinc, which are more bioavailable in animal products.",0.07705853134,0.6463490129

However, further clinical studies are needed to establish standardized protocols and confirm long-term benefits and safety. Patients should consult healthcare professionals before starting any new supplement regimen.",0.2847544849,0.6485208273
Does co-supplementation with beetroot juice and other nutritional supplements positively impact sports performance?,"Our findings show that the effectiveness of combining beetroot juice with another supplement mainly depends on the duration of the chronic intervention, which is where the greatest benefits have been observed.","In conclusion, while beetroot juice has demonstrated benefits in improving performance and recovery in various sports settings, its effectiveness as part of a co-supplementation strategy with other supplements like caffeine may not provide additional benefits beyond those offered by each supplement alone. Athletes considering supplementation should tailor their approach based on the specific demands of their sport and their individual physiological responses.",0.2611985803,0.654742837
Does the ketogenic diet improve neurological disorders by influencing gut microbiota?,The ketogenic diet prescribed in neurological patients has effectively altered the gut microbiota composition and gut microbiota-derived metabolites.,"In conclusion, the ketogenic diet does improve symptoms of certain neurological disorders, and its interaction with gut microbiota is a key component of its mechanism of action. However, careful consideration of the diet's composition and its long-term effects on gut health is crucial.",0.3941654861,0.6610897183
Do vegetarian diets provide adequate nutrient intake during complementary feeding?,"Based on current evidence, vegetarian and vegan diets during the complementary feeding period have not been shown to be safe, and the current best evidence suggests that the risk of critical micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies and growth retardation is high: they may result in significantly different outcomes in neuropsychological development and growth when compared with a healthy omnivorous diet such as the Mediterranean Diet. There are also no data documenting the protective effect of vegetarian or vegan diets against communicable diseases in children aged 6 months to 2-3 years.","Vegetarian diets can potentially provide adequate nutrition during complementary feeding if they are carefully planned and managed to ensure sufficient intake of critical nutrients like iron and zinc. It is essential for caregivers to consult with healthcare providers or dietitians to tailor the diet to the child's specific nutritional needs, taking into account any potential deficiencies. The inclusion of fortified foods or supplements might be necessary to meet the complete nutritional requirements.",0.09125140309,0.6629832387
Is consuming yoghurt associated with weight management outcomes?,"Yoghurt consumption is associated with lower body mass index, lower body weight/weight gain, smaller waist circumference and lower body fat in epidemiological studies. randomized controlled trials suggest weight reduction effects, but do not permit determination of a cause-effect relationship. Well-controlled, adequately powered trials in research and community settings appear likely to identify a modest but beneficial effect of yoghurt consumption for prevention of weight gain and management of obesity. The ready availability of yoghurt (a nutrient-dense food) and its ease of introduction to most diets suggests that educating the public to eat yoghurt as part of a balanced and healthy diet may potentially contribute to improved public health. Future carefully designed randomized controlled trials could provide proof of principle and large community-based studies could determine the practical impact of yoghurt on body weight/composition.","Yogurt consumption can aid in weight management by enhancing fat loss, particularly central adiposity. Probiotic and vitamin D-fortified yogurts can offer additional health benefits, including improvements in metabolic health markers and modulation of satiety signals. Regular yogurt intake is associated with favorable changes in body composition metrics like body mass index and waist circumference. The effects of yogurt on weight management can vary depending on factors such as the type of yogurt (e.g., probiotic, vitamin D-fortified), the genetic background of individuals, and the presence of other dietary controls. Incorporating yogurt into a balanced diet can be beneficial for weight management. However, individual results may vary, and it is essential to consider overall dietary patterns and lifestyle factors.",0.1489517093,0.6677079201

It is a staple of the Mediterranean diet, which is known for its numerous health benefits.",0.1643767655,0.6819694638
Are isolated and complex fiber supplements good choices for weight management?,"Overall, findings indicated that the efficacy of fiber supplements on obesity management is dependent on their contents and physicochemical properties. It seems that fiber supplements with no weight-loss interventions did not have considerable antiobesity effects. However, due to limited studies on each type of fiber, findings should be declared by caution. Additional research is needed on comparison of different fiber supplements in similar conditions to clarify the best type and dosage of fiber supplement as a complementary therapy in obesity management.","Both isolated and complex fiber supplements can be effective for weight management. They help increase satiety, reduce appetite, and can contribute to an overall healthier diet. It's advisable to incorporate these fibers as part of a balanced diet and to consider the form of fiber to maximize satiety and weight management benefits. As always, individuals should consult with healthcare providers or dietitians to tailor fiber intake and weight management strategies to their personal health needs.",0.1576663405,0.6904413104
Is there an association between diet and depression in children and adolescents?,"Despite some contradictory results, overall there was support for an association between healthy dietary patterns or consumption of a high-quality diet and lower levels of depression or better mental health. Similarly, there was a relationship between unhealthy diet and consumption of low-quality diet and depression or poor mental health. However, where significant relationships were reported, effect sizes were small. Future research on the relationship between diet and mental health in young people should use more clearly defined constructs to define diet and include or control for important confounders.","In conclusion, while there is evidence suggesting associations between various dietary factors and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents, the relationships are complex and influenced by multiple factors including psychosocial elements and overall dietary patterns. Further high-quality research is needed to establish clear guidelines and recommendations.",0.2814955115,0.6929318309
Is the Phenylalanine-Restricted Diet a risk factor for overweight or obesity in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU)?,"Body mass index (body mass index) was similar between patients with Phenylketonuria and healthy controls, providing no evidence to support the idea that a Phe-restricted diet is a risk factor for the development of overweight. However, a subgroup of patients with classical Phenylketonuria had a significantly higher body mass index than healthy controls. Given the increasing prevalence of overweight in the general population, patients with Phenylketonuria require lifelong follow-up, receiving personalised nutritional counselling, with methodical nutritional status monitoring from a multidisciplinary team in inherited metabolic disorders.","In conclusion, while the phenylalanine-restricted diet is essential for managing Phenylketonuria, it appears to be a contributing factor to the risk of overweight or obesity, especially when dietary management is not optimal or tailored to individual needs.

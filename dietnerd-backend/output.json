Fiber has been linked to the prevention of a number of cardiovascular diseases and disorders. \u03b2-Glucan, the main soluble fiber component in oat grains, was initially linked to a reduction in plasma cholesterol. Several studies have shown afterward that dietary fiber may also improve glycaemia, insulin resistance and weight loss. The effect of dietary fiber on arterial blood pressure has been the subject of far fewer studies than its effect on the above-mentioned variables, but research has already shown that fiber intake can decrease arterial blood pressure in hypertensive rats. Moreover, certain fibers can improve arterial blood pressure when administered to hypertensive and pre-hypertensive subjects.

Dietary fiber is a non-digestible form of carbohydrates, due to the lack of the digestive enzyme in humans required to digest fiber. Dietary fibers and lignin are intrinsic to plants and are classified according to their water solubility properties as either soluble or insoluble fibers. Water-soluble fibers include pectin, gums, mucilage, fructans, and some resistant starches. They are present in some fruits, vegetables, oats, and barley. Soluble fibers have been shown to lower blood cholesterol by several mechanisms. On the other hand, water-insoluble fibers mainly include lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose; whole-grain foods, bran, nuts, and seeds are rich in these fibers. Water-insoluble fibers have rapid gastric emptying, and as such may decrease the intestinal transit time and increase fecal bulk, thus promoting digestive regularity. In addition to dietary fiber, isolated and extracted fibers are known as functional fiber and have been shown to induce beneficial health effects when added to food during processing. The recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for total fiber intake for men and women aged 19-50 are 38 gram/day and 25 gram/day, respectively. It is worth noting that the RDA recommendations are for healthy people and do not apply to individuals with some chronic diseases. Studies have shown that most Americans do not consume the recommended intake of fiber. This review will summarize the current knowledge regarding dietary fiber, sources of food containing fiber, atherosclerosis, and heart disease risk reduction.\", \"citation\": \"Soliman GA.

Carefully controlled metabolic studies have shown that high-cholesterol intakes cause moderate increases in serum cholesterol levels. It is been difficult to verify this in population studies because of confounding factors. Nonetheless, meta-analysis of controlled studies documents a cholesterol-raising action of dietary cholesterol. Most of this effect occurs in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), but the cholesterol content of other lipoproteins can be increased as well. Moreover, population studies strongly suggest that dietary cholesterol is atherogenic beyond any rise in LDL concentrations. It must be emphasized that dietary cholesterol is only one of several dietary factors influencing serum cholesterol levels. Others include saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, soluble fiber, and total caloric intake. To achieve substantial serum cholesterol lowering, favorable changes in all of these factors must be combined. To maximize cardiovascular risk reduction, a lifetime of a healthy diet is needed. Reduced cholesterol intake is only one of several factors required to achieve such a diet. In addition, reduction of cholesterol absorption can enhance serum cholesterol lowering. This can be attained by the addition of plant sterols or plant stanols to the diet or by use of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption blocker. By combining dietary cholesterol reduction with other cholesterol-lowering modalities, it should be possible to substantially reduce atherosclerosis throughout life short of using cholesterol-lowering drugs that act systemically.\", \"citation\": \"Grundy SM.

Modern dietary practices have seen a significant reduction in fibre consumption compared with ancestral habits. This is related to the emergence of low-fibre \\\"Western diets\\\" associated with industrialised nations, and is linked to an increased prevalence of gut diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type II diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. The characteristic metabolic parameters of these individuals include insulin resistance, high fasting and postprandial glucose, as well as high plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Gut microbial signatures are also altered significantly in these cohorts, suggesting a causative link between diet, microbes and disease. Dietary fibre consumption has been hypothesised to reverse these changes through microbial fermentation and the subsequent production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which improves glucose and lipid parameters in individuals who harbour diseases associated with dysfunctional metabolism.

The optimal daily intake of dietary fiber for risk reduction is between 25g and 29g. The evidence suggests causal relationships between high intake of dietary fiber and reduced risk of several non-communicable diseases. Recommendations for increasing dietary fiber and replacing refined grains with whole grains could significantly benefit public health.\\n\\n3. **Risks**: No specific risks related to high intake of dietary fiber or whole grains were mentioned. The review focused on the benefits and risk reductions associated with these dietary components.\\n\\n4. **Benefits**: Benefits include significant reductions in body weight, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and lower incidence and mortality rates of several major diseases. Higher intakes of dietary fiber were associated with greater benefits, suggesting a dose-response relationship.\\n\\n5. **Search Methodology and Scope**: Literature was identified through searches in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, supplemented by hand searching of prior publications.

We aimed to more precisely quantify the predictive potential of several markers, to determine which markers are most useful, and to establish an evidence base for quantitative recommendations for intakes of dietary fibre.\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nWe did a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies published from database inception to April 30, 2017, and randomised controlled trials published from database inception to Feb 28, 2018, which reported on indicators of carbohydrate quality and non-communicable disease incidence, mortality, and risk factors. Studies were identified by searches in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and by hand searching of previous publications. We excluded prospective studies and trials reporting on participants with a chronic disease, and weight loss trials or trials involving supplements. Searches, data extraction, and bias assessment were duplicated independently. Robustness of pooled estimates from random-effects models was considered with sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, dose-response testing, and subgroup analyses. The GRADE approach was used to assess quality of evidence.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nJust under 135 million person-years of data from 185 prospective studies and 58 clinical trials with 4635 adult participants were included in the analyses. Observational data suggest a 15-30% decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality, and incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke incidence and mortality, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer when comparing the highest dietary fibre consumers with the lowest consumers Clinical trials show significantly lower bodyweight, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol when comparing higher with lower intakes of dietary fibre. Risk reduction associated with a range of critical outcomes was greatest when daily intake of dietary fibre was between 25 g and 29 g. Dose-response curves suggested that higher intakes of dietary fibre could confer even greater benefit to protect against cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal and breast cancer. Similar findings for whole grain intake were observed. Smaller or no risk reductions were found with the observational data when comparing the effects of diets characterised by low rather than higher glycaemic index or load. The certainty of evidence for relationships between carbohydrate quality and critical outcomes was graded as moderate for dietary fibre, low to moderate for whole grains, and low to very low for dietary glycaemic index and glycaemic load. Data relating to other dietary exposures are scarce.\\n\\nINTERPRETATION:\\nFindings from prospective studies and clinical trials associated with relatively high intakes of dietary fibre and whole grains were complementary, and striking dose-response evidence indicates that the relationships to several non-communicable diseases could be causal. Implementation of recommendations to increase dietary fibre intake and to replace refined grains with whole grains is expected to benefit human health. A major strength of the study was the ability to examine key indicators of carbohydrate quality in relation to a range of non-communicable disease outcomes from cohort studies and randomised trials in a single study. Our findings are limited to risk reduction in the population at large rather than those with chronic disease.\\n\\nFUNDING:\\nHealth Research Council of New Zealand, WHO, Riddet Centre of Research Excellence, Healthier Lives National Science Challenge, University of Otago, and the Otago Southland Diabetes Research Trust.\", \"citation\": \"Reynolds A, Mann J, Cummings J, Winter N, Mete E, Te Morenga L.

The included trials had either a low or unclear bias risk for most of the assessed risk parameters. Cardiovascular incidence or mortality were not evaluated in any of the included trials. Among the planned comparisons regarding patients' lipidemic profile, a significant difference was noticed for the following comparisons and outcomes: omega-3 fatty acids reduced triglycerides (mean difference (MD): -0.27 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.47 to -0.07, <i>p</i> < 0.01) when compared with placebo. A non-significant trend towards a reduction in subjects' total cholesterol (MD: -0.34, 95% CI: -0.68 to 0, mmol/L, <i>p</i> = 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -0.31, 95% CI: -0.61 to 0, mmol/L, <i>p</i> = 0.05) was noticed. In comparison with cholesterol-lowering diet, the additional consumption of plant stanols decreased total cholesterol (MD: -0.62 mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -0.58 mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.08 to -0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.02).

On the other hand, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids effectively reduces triglycerides and might have a role in lowering the cholesterol of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

We have considered the role of high-fibre diets on mortality and increasing fibre intake on glycaemic control and other cardiometabolic risk factors of adults with prediabetes or diabetes.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\\nWe conducted a systematic review of published literature to identify prospective studies or controlled trials that have examined the effects of a higher fibre intake without additional dietary or other lifestyle modification in adults with prediabetes, gestational diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Meta-analyses were undertaken to determine the effects of higher fibre intake on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and increasing fibre intake on glycaemic control and a range of cardiometabolic risk factors. For trials, meta regression analyses identified further variables that influenced the pooled findings. Dose response testing was undertaken; Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) protocols were followed to assess the quality of evidence. Two multicountry cohorts of 8,300 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes followed on average for 8.8 years and 42 trials including 1,789 adults with prediabetes, type 1, or type 2 diabetes were identified. Prospective cohort data indicate an absolute reduction of 14 fewer deaths (95% confidence interval (CI) 4-19) per 1,000 participants over the study duration, when comparing a daily dietary fibre intake of 35 g with the average intake of 19 g, with a clear dose response relationship apparent. Increased fibre intakes reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; mean difference [MD] -2.00 mmol/mol, 95% CI -3.30 to -0.71 from 33 trials), fasting plasma glucose (MD -0.56 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.38 from 34 trials), insulin (standardised mean difference [SMD] -2.03, 95% CI -2.92 to -1.13 from 19 trials), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR; MD -1.24 mg/dL, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.76 from 9 trials), total cholesterol (MD -0.34 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.22 from 27 trials), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD -0.17 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.08 from 21 trials), triglycerides (MD -0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.09 from 28 trials), body weight (MD -0.56 kg, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.13 from 18 trials), Body Mass Index (BMI; MD -0.36, 95% CI -0\u00b755 to -0\u00b716 from 14 trials), and C-reactive protein (SMD -2.80, 95% CI -4.52 to -1.09 from 7 trials) when compared with lower fibre diets. All trial analyses were subject to high heterogeneity. Key variables beyond increasing fibre intake were the fibre intake at baseline, the global region where the trials were conducted, and participant inclusion criteria other than diabetes type. Potential limitations were the lack of prospective cohort data in non-European countries and the lack of long-term (12 months or greater) controlled trials of increasing fibre intakes in adults with diabetes.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nHigher-fibre diets are an important component of diabetes management, resulting in improvements in measures of glycaemic control, blood lipids, body weight, and inflammation, as well as a reduction in premature mortality. These benefits were not confined to any fibre type or to any type of diabetes and were apparent across the range of intakes, although greater improvements in glycaemic control were observed for those moving from low to moderate or high intakes. Based on these findings, increasing daily fibre intake by 15 g or to 35 g might be a reasonable target that would be expected to reduce risk of premature mortality in adults with diabetes.\", \"citation\": \"Reynolds AN, Akerman AP, Mann J.

This disease is caused by loss-of-function genetic mutations in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G member 5 or member 8 (ABCG5 or ABCG8, respectively), both of which play important roles in the selective excretion of plant sterols from the liver and intestine, leading to a failure to excrete plant sterols. Sitosterolemia, which is currently considered a rare genetic disorder, has been described as a phenocopy of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Typical phenotypes of sitosterolemia, including elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, tendon xanthomas, and premature coronary artery disease, overlap those of homozygous FH; however, there are substantial differences between these two diseases in terms of treatments and prognoses. Moreover, it is of note that sitosterolemia appears to be quite underdiagnosed, although accurate diagnosis and appropriate interventions will likely to lead to better prognoses compared with homozygous FH. Unlike cases of homozygous FH, dietary counseling is quite effective in reducing the LDL cholesterol as well as sitosterol of patients with sitosterolemia.

We performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses, funnel plots and GRADE assessment.\\n\\nMAIN RESULTS:\\nWe included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (16 comparisons, ~59,000 participants), that used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on reducing saturated fat. The included long-term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular events by 21% (risk ratio (RR) 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.93, 11 trials, 53,300 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, I\u00b2 = 65%, GRADE moderate-quality evidence). Meta-regression suggested that greater reductions in saturated fat (reflected in greater reductions in serum cholesterol) resulted in greater reductions in risk of CVD events, explaining most heterogeneity between trials. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 56 in primary prevention trials, so 56 people need to reduce their saturated fat intake for ~four years for one person to avoid experiencing a CVD event. In secondary prevention trials, the NNTB was 32. Subgrouping did not suggest significant differences between replacement of saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate, and data on replacement with monounsaturated fat and protein was very limited. We found little or no effect of reducing saturated fat on all-cause mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; 11 trials, 55,858 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 10 trials, 53,421 participants), both with GRADE moderate-quality evidence. There was little or no effect of reducing saturated fats on non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07) or CHD mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16, both low-quality evidence), but effects on total (fatal or non-fatal) myocardial infarction, stroke and CHD events (fatal or non-fatal) were all unclear as the evidence was of very low quality. There was little or no effect on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses, diabetes diagnosis, HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides or blood pressure, and small reductions in weight, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and BMI. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes.\\n\\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:\\nThe findings of this updated review suggest that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years causes a potentially important reduction in combined cardiovascular events. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate appear to be useful strategies, while effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat are unclear.

This recommendation follows largely from the observation that saturated fats can raise levels of total serum cholesterol (TC), thereby putatively increasing the risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). However, TC is only modestly associated with CHD, and more important than the total level of cholesterol in the blood may be the number and size of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles that contain it. As for saturated fats, these fats are a diverse class of compounds; different fats may have different effects on LDL and on broader CHD risk based on the specific saturated fatty acids (SFAs) they contain. Importantly, though, people eat foods, not isolated fatty acids. Some food sources of SFAs may pose no risk for CHD or possibly even be protective. Advice to reduce saturated fat in the diet without regard to nuances about LDL, SFAs, or dietary sources could actually increase people's risk of CHD. When saturated fats are replaced with refined carbohydrates, and specifically with added sugars (like sucrose or high fructose corn syrup), the end result is not favorable for heart health. Such replacement leads to changes in LDL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides that may increase the risk of CHD. Additionally, diets high in sugar may induce many other abnormalities associated with elevated CHD risk, including elevated levels of glucose, insulin, and uric acid, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin and leptin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered platelet function. A diet high in added sugars has been found to cause a 3-fold increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, but sugars, like saturated fats, are a diverse class of compounds. The monosaccharide, fructose, and fructose-containing sweeteners (e.g., sucrose) produce greater degrees of metabolic abnormalities than does glucose (either isolated as a monomer, or in chains as starch) and may present greater risk of CHD. This paper reviews the evidence linking saturated fats and sugars to CHD, and concludes that the latter is more of a problem than the former. Dietary guidelines should shift focus away from reducing saturated fat, and from replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, specifically when these carbohydrates are refined. To reduce the burden of CHD, guidelines should focus particularly on reducing intake of concentrated sugars, specifically the fructose-containing sugars like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in the form of ultra-processed foods and beverages.\", \"citation\": \"DiNicolantonio JJ, Lucan SC, O'Keefe JH.

Some factors related to food format, e.g., solid vs. liquid foods, seem to impact efficacy, while there is no difference between free PSS and esters. Compared to multiple daily intakes, once-a-day intake of PSS, especially in the morning with light breakfast, leads to a sub-optimal LDL-C lowering. However, intake frequency seems influenced by intake occasion, i.e., with or without a meal, and time of day. Meal intake is a critical factor for an optimal LDL-C lowering efficacy of PSS. While age has no impact, gender is suggested to influence the LDL-C lowering effect of PSS with greater reductions reported for men than women; but overall evidence is inconclusive and larger studies show no gender by treatment interaction.

It has been proved that LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) plays causal role in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. The fact that atherosclerosis is a chronic and progressive disease which onsets during the first three decades of life bores questions what to do to maintain LDL-C at low levels throughout life and thus to delay and/or prevent the progress this disease. Currently, most of public health expenses are spared on treatment, but not on prophylaxis.\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nThis is a review article summarizing novel reports concerning the efficacy of sterols/stanols as lipidlowering agents, assessing their influence on cardiovascular risk and safety.\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nIt has been suggested that sterols and stanols are effective in the lowering of low-density cholesterol levels and diminishing cardiovascular risk. However, the results of other studies suggest that phytosterols may not exert positive effects during atherogenesis. Firstly, patients with phytosterolaemia (genetic disease in which high plant sterol plasma concentrations are observed) develop malignant premature atherosclerosis. Moreover, several epidemiological studies demonstrated the association between upper normal plasma concentrations of plant sterols and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, the supplementation with plant stanols and plant sterols may be not beneficial due to their incorporation in various tissues and potentially resulting in adverse effects.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nDespite the worldwide promotion of sterols as health improving supplements, it seems that in some people responding with relatively high phytosterol serum levels after its consumption such additives may turn out to be as good as it has been believed.\", \"citation\": \"Rysz J, Franczyk B, Olszewski R, Banach M, Gluba-Brzozka A.

The review specifically investigates the intake of 2 g/day of plant sterols and stanols.\\n\\n2. **Main Conclusions**: The review concludes that daily intake of 2 g of plant sterols and stanols reduces serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by approximately 10%. It finds that while plant sterol supplementation does increase serum plant sterol concentrations, these levels are significantly lower than those in conditions like homozygous sitosterolemia, suggesting minimal health risks. The review also notes that reductions in serum concentrations of fat-soluble (pro)vitamins are generally not a concern when adjusted for cholesterol, except for small reductions in beta-carotene, which are not considered significant. No adverse effects on sex hormone metabolism have been demonstrated, except in experimental animal studies with large, parenteral doses.\\n\\n3. **Risks**: The review discusses potential risks including increased serum plant sterol levels and reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. However, it generally dismisses these concerns based on the current evidence, suggesting that the levels of plant sterols remain within a safe range and that the vitamin absorption issue is largely resolved when adjusted for cholesterol levels.\\n\\n4. **Benefits**: The primary benefit discussed is the significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels by approximately 10% with a daily intake of 2 g of plant sterols and stanols, which can contribute to cardiovascular health.\\n\\n5. **Search Methodology and Scope**: The review appears to include clinical trials and studies concerning cholesterol-lowering effects, safety profiles regarding serum plant sterol levels, fat-soluble vitamin absorption, and effects on serum sex hormone balance.

Trials of cholesterol lowering demonstrate that intake of 2 g/day of plant sterols and stanols reduces serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations by approximately 10%. Safety concerns regarding elevations in serum plant sterol levels, or effects on fat-soluble vitamin absorption or hypothetical effects on serum sex hormone balance have received attention and been addressed in studies. Plant sterol (but not stanol) supplementation increased serum plant sterol concentrations but these levels remained much lower than those observed in homozygous sitosterolemia making an adverse health effect unlikely. Prolonged statin therapy also causes elevations in all cholesterol-adjusted plant sterol levels as well as small but significant elevations in serum unadjusted campesterol levels from baseline. This is probably caused by a statin-induced reduction in biliary cholesterol efflux resulting in a diminished intestinal cholesterol pool. The diminished competition with cholesterol molecules allows more plant sterol molecules to become incorporated in mixed micelles facilitating their uptake in enterocytes. With the exception of beta-carotene, reductions in serum concentrations of fat-soluble (pro)vitamins are usually abolished by adjustment for cholesterol suggesting that they reflect reductions in carrier lipoproteins, mainly LDL. The small reductions in serum beta-carotene are not regarded as a major concern, nor have any adverse effects on sex hormone metabolism been demonstrated apart from parenteral administration of large doses in experimental animals. However, as increasing consumer populations become exposed to a large variety of food products enriched with plant sterols and stanols the likelihood of rare adverse effects increases and surveillance is necessary.\", \"citation\": \"Tikkanen MJ.

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, however, recommends regular consumption of this food along with seeds and dried beans (4-5 servings per week) as part of a diet to control hypertension. Nuts are nutrient-dense and most of their fat is unsaturated. They are also perhaps the best natural source of vitamin E and are relatively concentrated repositories of dietary fiber, magnesium, potassium, and arginine, the dietary precursor of nitric oxide. Human feeding studies have demonstrated reductions of 8-12% in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when almonds and walnuts are substituted for more traditional fats. Other studies show that macadamias and hazelnuts appear at least as beneficial as fats in commonly recommended diets. Whether consuming modest quantities of nuts daily may promote weight gain is not known with certainty, but preliminary data suggest that this is unlikely. Four of the best and largest cohort studies in nutritional epidemiology have now reported that eating nuts frequently is associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease of the order of 30-50%. The findings are very consistent in subgroup analyses and unlikely to be due to confounding. Possible mechanisms include reduction in LDL cholesterol, the antioxidant actions of vitamin E, and the effects on the endothelium and platelet function of higher levels of nitric oxide. Although nuts may account for a relatively small percentage of dietary calories, the potential interacting effects of these factors on disease risk may be considerable.\", \"citation\": \"Fraser GE.

Dietary proteins are important nutrients and are classified into: 1) animal proteins (meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy), and, 2) plant proteins (legumes, nuts and soy). Dietary modification is one of the most important lifestyle changes that has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) by attenuating related risk factors. The CVD burden is reduced by optimum diet through replacement of unprocessed meat with low saturated fat, animal proteins and plant proteins. In view of the available evidence, it has become acceptable to emphasize the role of optimum nutrition to maintain arterial and CV health. Such healthy diets are thought to increase satiety, facilitate weight loss, and improve CV risk. Different studies have compared the benefits of omnivorous and vegetarian diets. Animal protein related risk has been suggested to be greater with red or processed meat over and above poultry, fish and nuts, which carry a lower risk for CVD. In contrast, others have shown no association of red meat intake with CVD. The aim of this expert opinion recommendation was to elucidate the different impact of animal vs vegetable protein on modifying cardiometabolic risk factors. Many observational and interventional studies confirmed that increasing protein intake, especially plant-based proteins and certain animal-based proteins (poultry, fish, unprocessed red meat low in saturated fats and low-fat dairy products) have a positive effect in modifying cardiometabolic risk factors. Red meat intake correlates with increased CVD risk, mainly because of its non-protein ingredients (saturated fats). However, the way red meat is cooked and preserved matters. Thus, it is recommended to substitute red meat with poultry or fish in order to lower CVD risk. Specific amino acids have favourable results in modifying major risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension. Apart from meat, other animal-source proteins, like those found in dairy products (especially whey protein) are inversely correlated to hypertension, obesity and insulin resistance.\", \"citation\": \".

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, however, recommends regular consumption of this food along with seeds and dried beans (4-5 servings per week) as part of a diet to control hypertension. Nuts are nutrient-dense and most of their fat is unsaturated. They are also perhaps the best natural source of vitamin E and are relatively concentrated repositories of dietary fibre, magnesium, potassium and arginine, which is the dietary precursor of nitric oxide. Human feeding studies have demonstrated reductions of 8-12% in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when almonds and walnuts are substituted for more traditional fats. Other studies show that macadamias and hazelnuts appear at least as beneficial as fats in commonly recommended diets. Whether the daily consumption of modest quantities of nuts may promote obesity is not known with certainty, but preliminary data suggest that this is unlikely. Four of the best and largest cohort studies in nutritional epidemiology have now reported that eating nuts frequently is associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease in the order of 30-50%. The findings are very consistent in subgroup analyses and unlikely to be due to confounding. Possible mechanisms include reduction in LDL cholesterol, the antioxidant actions of vitamin E, and the effects on the endothelium and platelet function of higher levels of nitric oxide.

These findings suggest potential pathways and targets for therapeutic interventions in obesity.\\n\\n3. **Risks:**\\n   - The paper does not explicitly discuss the risks associated with moderate calorie restriction in the context of the study. Generally, calorie restriction must be managed carefully to avoid malnutrition or other adverse effects, but specific risks are not detailed in this study.\\n\\n4. **Benefits:**\\n   - Benefits include reduced body weight, lower serum cholesterol, reduced fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, decreased white adipogenesis, reduced hepatic fat deposition, and increased energy expenditure. These changes are associated with increased expression of beneficial proteins and enzymes like SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and phosphorylated AMPK.\\n\\n5. **Search Methodology and Scope:**\\n   - The specific search strategy for literature is not detailed in the abstract. The scope appears focused on experimental research involving animal models to investigate the biochemical and physiological impacts of calorie restriction on obesity.\\n\\n6. **Selection Criteria:**\\n   - The study involves experimental models using male C57BL/6 mice, with groups divided based on diet (standard vs. high-fat) and subsequent calorie restriction. The selection criteria for studies or data included in the paper, beyond this experimental setup, are not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n7. **Quality Assessment of Included Studies:**\\n   - The paper does not provide specific details on the quality assessment of the studies included. The experimental methods, however, suggest a controlled and systematic approach to testing the hypothesis, with clear definitions of control and experimental groups.\\n\\n8. **Synthesis and Analysis:**\\n   - **Statistical Analysis:** Utilizes one-way ANOVA for comparing group means, followed by Dunnett\u2019s t-test, with a significance level set at P < 0.05.\\n   - **Interpretation:** Statistically significant differences were found between the control (high-fat diet) and intervention (calorie-restricted) groups in terms of body weight, metabolic parameters, and protein expression, suggesting effective modulation of the targeted metabolic pathways.\\n\\n9. **Sources of Funding or Conflict of Interest:**\\n   - **Funding:** Supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China and the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province.\\n   - **Conflict of Interest:** No conflicts of interest declared.

Calorie restriction (CR) is a safety and effective life intervention to defend against obesity. Short-term moderate CR may be a more favorable strategy against this pathology. However, the mechanisms behind the effects of CR remain to be clarified. Increased energy expenditure in the liver and brown adipose tissue could potentially be manipulated to modulate and improve metabolism in obesity. Moreover, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are well-characterized metabolic modulators. We aim to explore the anti-obesity effects of short-term moderate CR by improving energy metabolism via the SIRT1/AMPK pathway in white adipocytes and liver in a mouse model of obesity.\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nMale C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two groups receiving either a standard or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks to induce obesity. The HFD-induced obese mice were further randomized into two groups: HFD group or CR group (received 75% of the food eaten by HFD group). Their energy metabolism, white adipose tissue (WAT) contents, hepatic fat deposition, the expression of AMPK, SIRT1, peroxisome proliferators \u03b3-activated receptor coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in WAT, and hepatic tissues were determined.\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nAfter 4 weeks, body weight, total serum cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and insulin levels were significantly lower in the CR group. Moreover, CR ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis, attenuated white adipogenesis, and increased energy expenditure and expressions of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and phosphorylated AMPK in subcutaneous WAT and the hepatic tissues. In addition, CR reduced the protein levels of NF-\u03baB and increased the eNOS expression.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nShort-term moderate CR decreases obesity, increases the thermogenesis, and inhibits inflammation in a mouse model of obesity, probably via the activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway in WAT and liver.\", \"citation\": \"Zhang S, Sun S, Wei X, Zhang M, Chen Y, Mao X, Chen G, Liu C.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is naturally synthesised by the body and can also be taken as a dietary supplement. Studies have shown that a CoQ10 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES:\\nTo determine the effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation as a single ingredient for the primary prevention of CVD.\\n\\nSEARCH METHODS:\\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to November week 3 2013); EMBASE (Ovid, 1947 to 27 November 2013) and other relevant resources on 2 December 2013. We applied no language restrictions.\\n\\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD but without a diagnosis of CVD. Trials investigated the supplementation of CoQ10 alone as a single supplement. The comparison group was no intervention or placebo. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors, adverse effects and costs. We excluded any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions to avoid confounding.\\n\\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:\\nTwo authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias.We contacted authors for additional information where necessary.\\n\\nMAIN RESULTS:\\nWe identified six RCTs with a total of 218 participants randomised, one trial awaiting classification and five ongoing trials. All trials were conducted in participants at high risk of CVD, two trials examined CoQ10 supplementation alone and four examined CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy; we analysed these separately. All six trials were small-scale, recruiting between 20 and 52 participants; one trial was at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and one for selective reporting; all studies were unclear in the method of allocation and therefore for selection bias. The dose of CoQ10 varied between 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and the duration of the interventions was similar at around three months.No studies reported mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events. None of the included studies provided data on adverse events.Two trials examined the effect of CoQ10 on blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure we did not perform a meta-analysis due to significant heterogeneity. In one trial CoQ10 supplementation had no effect on systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -1.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.17 to 9.37, 51 patients randomised). In the other trial there was a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -15.00 mmHg, 95% CI -19.06 to -10.94, 20 patients randomised). For diastolic blood pressure we performed a random-effects meta-analysis, which showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation when these two small trials were pooled (MD -1.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.2 to 1.96).One trial (51 patients randomised) looked at the effect of CoQ10 on lipid levels. The trial showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation on total cholesterol (MD 0.30 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.70), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (MD 0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17) or triglycerides (MD 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.52).Of the four trials that investigated CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy, three of them showed that simultaneous administration of CoQ10 did not significantly influence lipid levels or systolic blood pressure levels between the two groups. The fourth trial showed a significant increase in the change in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol at three months across the four arms of the trial (\u03b1-tocopherol, CoQ10, CoQ10 + \u03b1-tocopherol and placebo), however the way in which the data were presented meant that we were unable to determine if there was any significant difference between the CoQ10 only and placebo arms. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the change in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides after three months between the four arms of the trial.\\n\\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:\\nThere are very few studies to date examining CoQ10 for the primary prevention of CVD. The results from the ongoing studies will add to the evidence base.

Purpose\\nThe review aims to explore and clarify the relationship between dietary cholesterol, blood cholesterol levels, saturated fatty acids, and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It seeks to address the hypothesis that dietary cholesterol contributes significantly to heart disease risk, a notion that has influenced dietary guidelines in the past. The review methodically examines existing literature, including observational studies and guidelines, to assess whether dietary cholesterol directly increases CVD risk. While specific dosages of dietary components (like the previously recommended limit of 300 mg/day of cholesterol) are mentioned, the review primarily focuses on summarizing and synthesizing broad findings rather than conducting new experimental research.\\n\\n### 2. Main Conclusions\\nThe review concludes that current literature does not support the idea that dietary cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease in healthy individuals. It highlights that while saturated fatty acids and trans-fats are linked to increased CVD risk, dietary cholesterol\u2014particularly from eggs, which are low in saturated fats but high in nutrients\u2014may not be a concern for heart disease in the general population. The review suggests that dietary guidelines might need reevaluation to reflect these findings, emphasizing balanced, nutrient-dense diets.\\n\\n### 3. Scope and Coverage\\nThe review appears to cover a broad spectrum of research related to dietary cholesterol, including its sources (like eggs and meat), its impact on blood cholesterol levels, and its association with CVD risk. It also delves into the mechanisms of cholesterol homeostasis in the body, indicating a comprehensive approach to understanding the topic. However, without access to the full list of references and studies included, it's challenging to fully assess the breadth and depth of the literature covered.\\n\\n### 4. Selection Criteria\\nThe review likely included a range of studies, from observational cohorts to dietary guidelines, based on their relevance to dietary cholesterol and CVD risk. Exclusion criteria are not explicitly mentioned, but the focus seems to be on studies that directly relate to the review's main questions. The appropriateness of these criteria would depend on how well they allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\\n\\n### 5. Search Methodology\\nWhile the review does not detail its search strategy, the references to specific dietary guidelines, observational studies, and mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism suggest a thorough search of both clinical and mechanistic studies. For a robust assessment, details on databases searched, keywords used, and time frames would be necessary.\\n\\n### 6. Inclusion of Diverse Perspectives\\nThe review acknowledges the complexity of dietary cholesterol's impact on health, mentioning that the relationship is not fully supported by current evidence and highlighting areas where further research is needed, such as in individuals with diabetes. This suggests an attempt to incorporate diverse perspectives and findings.\\n\\n### 7. Quality Assessment of Included Studies\\nThere's no explicit mention of a systematic quality assessment of the studies included in the review. Such an assessment is crucial for evaluating the strength and reliability of the evidence presented.\\n\\n### 8. Synthesis and Analysis\\nThe review synthesizes findings from various studies to conclude that dietary cholesterol may not significantly impact heart disease risk in healthy individuals. However, without details on the synthesis methodology (e.g., meta-analysis, narrative synthesis), it's hard to evaluate the robustness of this conclusion.\\n\\n### 9.

Main Conclusions\\n\\nThe review concludes that industrial trans fatty acids are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, primarily through raising total and LDL cholesterol levels while lowering HDL cholesterol. It also highlights that these fats influence inflammation, ER stress, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism, with a notable effect of promoting fat storage in the liver.

It aims to understand how these fats affect human health, particularly their link to heart disease. The paper looks at a wide range of studies to paint a full picture, from how these fats behave in our bodies to their impact on our cholesterol levels and liver health. While industrially made trans fats are shown to be harmful, the fats naturally found in animal products might have a different effect, suggesting we need to learn more about them. The review calls for more detailed studies to better understand these fats, which could lead to new ways to treat or prevent diseases related to fat metabolism.\", \"citation\": \"Oteng AB, Kersten S.
